## Context & Background

### User Persona
**Name:** Olivia the Occasional Traveler
**Description:** A cat owner who travels infrequently with her cat and doesn't want to invest in purchasing a high-quality, airline-compliant carrier for rare use, or is unsure which carrier meets regulations.
**Goals:**
- To easily access suitable travel containers without significant upfront cost.
- To be confident that the container meets all necessary travel regulations.

**Pain Points:**
- Cost of purchasing specialized carriers.
- Confusion about carrier size and compliance requirements for different airlines/modes of transport.

### Business Context
This story provides a practical solution for a common logistical challenge, offering convenience and potentially generating revenue through rentals or sales. It enhances the app's utility beyond just information.

### Current State vs Desired State
| Current State | Desired State |
|--------------|---------------|
| Researching and purchasing carriers, often with uncertainty about compliance | Easy rental/purchase of verified, compliant carriers through the app |

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Browse Available Containers
**Priority:** Must Have

**Given** I am in the app's travel container section
**When** I browse available containers for rent or purchase
**Then** I should see a catalog of cat-approved carriers with details on size, features, and compliance (e.g., airline-approved)

### AC-2: Rent/Purchase Process
**Priority:** Must Have

**Given** I have selected a travel container
**When** I proceed to rent or purchase it
**Then** I should be guided through a clear process for selection, payment, and delivery/pickup arrangements

### AC-3: Container Compliance Information
**Priority:** Must Have

**Given** I am viewing a specific travel container
**When** I review its details
**Then** I should see explicit information about its compliance with major airline standards (e.g., IATA compliant, specific airline approvals)
