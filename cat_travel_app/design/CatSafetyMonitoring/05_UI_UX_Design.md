# CatSafetyMonitoring: UI/UX Design

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for the Cat Safety & Monitoring feature. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive, and reassuring interface for users to monitor their cat's safety.

## 2. Wireframes and Mockups

*(Note: This section would typically contain visual wireframes and mockups from a design tool like Figma or Sketch. For this text-based representation, we will describe the key screens.)*

### 2.1 Main Tracking Screen
- **Description**: The primary screen for the feature. It will be a map-centric view.
- **Elements**:
    - A map that takes up most of the screen, displaying the cat's current location with a custom cat icon.
    - The user's current location is also shown for reference.
    - An overlay panel at the bottom with the cat's name, profile picture, and the tag's status (e.g., "Active", "Low Battery") and battery percentage.
    - A button to view location history.
    - A button to manage geofences.

### 2.2 Location History Screen
- **Description**: A screen to view the cat's past movements.
- **Elements**:
    - A map showing the historical path of the cat for a selected time period.
    - A date/time range selector to filter the history.
    - A list view of location points with timestamps.

### 2.3 Geofence Management Screen
- **Description**: A screen to create, view, and manage geofences.
- **Elements**:
    - A list of existing geofences with their name and status (active/inactive).
    - A button to create a new geofence.
    - When creating/editing a geofence, the user can set the center point on a map and adjust the radius with a slider.

## 3. User Flows

### 3.1 Viewing Cat's Location

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant LS as Location Service

    U->>App: Opens Cat Safety feature
    App->>API: GET /locations/{tag_id}?limit=1
    API->>LS: Get latest location
    LS-->>API: Latest location data
    API-->>App: Location data
    App->>U: Displays cat's location on map
```

### 3.2 Creating a Geofence

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> GeofenceList
    GeofenceList --> CreateGeofence: User taps "Create"
    CreateGeofence --> SetLocation: User selects location on map
    SetLocation --> SetRadius: User adjusts radius
    SetRadius --> SetName: User names the geofence
    SetName --> Saving: User taps "Save"
    Saving --> GeofenceList: Geofence saved successfully
    Saving --> CreateGeofence: Error saving
```

### 3.3 Receiving a Geofence Alert

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cat as Cat (with Tag)
    participant GPS as GPS Service
    participant LS as Location Service
    participant GS as Geofence Service
    participant NS as Notification Service
    participant UserDevice as User's Device

    Cat->>GPS: Moves outside geofence
    GPS->>LS: Pushes new location data
    LS->>GS: Publishes location_updated event
    GS->>GS: Evaluates location against geofences
    GS->>NS: Publishes geofence_breached event
    NS->>UserDevice: Sends push notification
    UserDevice->>UserDevice: Displays alert to user
```

## 4. Accessibility

- **Color Contrast**: The UI will use color combinations that meet WCAG AA standards.
- **Screen Readers**: All UI elements will have appropriate labels for screen readers.
- **Haptic Feedback**: The app will use haptic feedback for important actions, like when a geofence is successfully created or an alert is received.
