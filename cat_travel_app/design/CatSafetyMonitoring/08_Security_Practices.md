# CatSafetyMonitoring: Security Practices

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security practices and considerations for the Cat Safety & Monitoring component. It is crucial to protect the sensitive location data of users' pets. All practices must align with the [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md).

## 2. Data Security

- **Data Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data in the PostgreSQL database, especially the `location_history` table, will be encrypted at the storage level using AES-256 encryption.
- **Data Encryption in Transit**: All communication between the mobile client and the API Gateway, and between internal services, will be encrypted using TLS 1.3.
- **Data Minimization**: We will only collect and store the data that is absolutely necessary for the feature to function. Location history will be retained for a configurable period, after which it will be anonymized or deleted.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints will be protected and require a valid JWT token. The token will contain the user's ID and roles.
- **Authorization**: The system will implement strict authorization checks. A user can only access data (tags, locations, geofences) that they own. This will be enforced at the API gateway and service levels.
- **Least Privilege**: Services will run with the minimum required permissions. For example, the Notification Service will not have access to the database.

## 4. Input Validation

- **API Input**: All input from the client will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS).
- **Location Data**: Incoming location data from the 3rd party GPS service will be validated to ensure it is within expected formats and ranges.

## 5. Secure Coding

- **Dependency Scanning**: The CI/CD pipeline will include automated scanning of all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: SAST tools will be used to analyze the source code for potential security flaws.
- **Secret Management**: All secrets (API keys, database credentials, JWT signing keys) will be stored in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and not in the codebase or environment variables.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: All security-sensitive events will be logged for auditing purposes. This includes login attempts, geofence creation/deletion, and data access.
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Logs will not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data. All sensitive values will be masked.
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts will be configured to detect and notify the security team of suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual API usage patterns.

## 7. Compliance

- **Data Privacy**: The system will be designed to comply with relevant data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This includes honoring user requests for data access and deletion.
