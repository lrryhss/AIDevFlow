# CatSafetyMonitoring: Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Cat Safety & Monitoring component. The goal is to ensure the feature is reliable, performant, secure, and meets all specified requirements.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual functions and classes within each microservice.
- **Tools**: Pytest for Python, Jest for the mobile app.
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage and 70% branch coverage.
- **Focus**: Testing business logic, edge cases, and error handling in isolation.

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interactions between microservices, and between services and external systems (database, message queue).
- **Tools**: Pytest with test containers for setting up dependencies.
- **Focus**: Verifying that services can communicate correctly, data is passed in the correct format, and events are published and consumed as expected.

### 2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Scope**: Complete user flows from the mobile app to the backend and back.
- **Tools**: A framework like Detox or Appium for mobile E2E testing.
- **Focus**: Simulating real user scenarios, such as registering a tag, viewing the location on the map, creating a geofence, and receiving an alert.

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1 Functional Testing
- **Objective**: To verify that the system behaves as expected according to the functional requirements.
- **Method**: A combination of unit, integration, and E2E tests will be used to cover all acceptance criteria.

### 3.2 Performance Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the system can handle the expected load and meets the performance requirements.
- **Tools**: A tool like Locust or k6.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Load Testing**: Simulate a large number of concurrent users viewing location data.
    - **Stress Testing**: Push the system to its limits to identify bottlenecks.
    - **Latency Testing**: Measure the time it takes for location updates to be processed and for alerts to be delivered.

### 3.3 Security Testing
- **Objective**: To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- **Method**:
    - **SAST/DAST**: Automated security testing tools will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration tests will be conducted by an external security team.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

### 3.4 Usability Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the mobile app interface is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Method**: User testing sessions with a small group of target users to gather feedback on the UI/UX design.

## 4. Test Environments

- **Development**: Local developer machines with mocked external services.
- **Testing/QA**: A dedicated environment that mirrors production as closely as possible, used for running integration and E2E tests.
- **Staging**: A pre-production environment for final validation and user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Production**: The live environment.

## 5. Automation

- **CI/CD**: All tests (unit, integration) will be run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline for every pull request.
- **E2E Tests**: E2E tests will be run nightly against the testing environment.
