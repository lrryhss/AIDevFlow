## Overview

This document outlines the high-level system architecture for the Cat Travel App. The application aims to provide a comprehensive platform for cat owners to plan and execute travel with their feline companions, addressing challenges related to cat-friendly accommodations, travel logistics, and safety.

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Cat Travel App's system architecture, detailing its core components, their interactions, and the underlying technologies. It serves as a foundational design document for subsequent detailed design efforts.

## 2. Architectural Goals

*   **Scalability:** The system shall be capable of handling a large and growing user base (up to 100,000 concurrent users) and increasing data volumes without significant degradation in performance.
*   **Security:** The system shall ensure the highest level of data privacy and protection, especially for sensitive user, pet, and location data, adhering to relevant data privacy regulations.
*   **Reliability:** The system shall provide highly accurate and consistently available services, particularly for critical features like cat tracking (within 3 meters accuracy) and payment processing.
*   **Usability:** The application shall be intuitive and easy to use, requiring no prior training for core functionalities.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture shall allow for easy integration of new features and third-party services.
*   **Maintainability:** The system shall promote a modular and well-structured codebase for ease of development and maintenance.

## 3. Architectural Principles

*   **Modularity:** Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive to facilitate independent development, testing, and deployment.
*   **API-First Design:** All internal and external interactions shall be exposed via well-defined APIs.
*   **Cloud-Native:** Leverage cloud services for scalability, reliability, and managed infrastructure.
*   **Security by Design:** Security considerations shall be integrated into every layer of the architecture from the outset.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure data integrity and consistency across all data stores.

## 4. System Components

### 4.1 Mobile Application (Client-Side)

*   **Description:** Native iOS and Android applications providing the primary user interface for interacting with the Cat Travel App.
*   **Responsibilities:** User authentication, displaying UI, handling user input, interacting with Backend Services, local data caching.
*   **Technology Considerations:** Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) or Flutter for cross-platform development, or native Swift/Kotlin for platform-specific development.

### 4.2 Backend Services (API Layer)

*   **Description:** A set of microservices or a modular monolith exposing RESTful or GraphQL APIs to the mobile application and interacting with various data stores and external services.
*   **Responsibilities:** User management, accommodation search/filtering, travel checklist management, container inventory/rental/purchase, cat tracking data ingestion/processing, external API integration, business logic execution.
*   **Technology Considerations:** Node.js with Express.js/FastAPI (Python) for API development, Spring Boot (Java) or .NET Core (C#) for enterprise-grade services.

### 4.3 Database

*   **Description:** Persistent data stores for all application data.
*   **Responsibilities:** Storing user profiles, pet information, travel plans, accommodation details, container inventory, tracking data, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Technology Considerations:** PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data, MongoDB or Cassandra for NoSQL data (e.g., for high-volume tracking data).

### 4.4 Caching Layer

*   **Description:** A distributed caching system to improve application performance by reducing database load and API response times.
*   **Responsibilities:** Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., accommodation listings, popular travel regulations), session management.
*   **Technology Considerations:** Redis or Memcached.

### 4.5 Notification Service

*   **Description:** A service responsible for sending various notifications to users.
*   **Responsibilities:** Delivering geofence alerts, travel reminders, container rental status updates.
*   **Technology Considerations:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification service (APNs), or a third-party notification platform.

## 6. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile / Flutter | Cross-platform mobile development |
| Backend | Node.js (Express.js) / Python (FastAPI) | API Server, Business Logic |
| Database | PostgreSQL / MongoDB | Data Storage |
| Caching | Redis | Distributed Caching |
| Notifications | FCM / APNs | Push Notifications |
| Cloud | AWS / Azure / GCP | Infrastructure and Managed Services |

## 7. Data Flow

Data flows from the Mobile App to Backend Services via API calls. Backend Services interact with Databases for persistence, Caching Layer for performance, and Notification Service for alerts. External Services provide data (Accommodation, GPS) or process transactions (Payment, Logistics).

## 8. Security Architecture

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust user authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) and fine-grained authorization to ensure users only access their own data.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt all sensitive data (user profiles, pet details, location history, payment information) both in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
*   **API Security:** Implement API rate limiting, API keys, and potentially Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
*   **Privacy by Design:** Incorporate privacy considerations from the outset, especially for location data, allowing users control over their data retention.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

The application will be deployed on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) leveraging managed services where possible. Backend services will be containerized (Docker) and orchestrated using Kubernetes or similar. Databases will utilize managed database services. Mobile applications will be deployed through respective app stores.

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Search results within 3-5 seconds; checklist/catalog load within 2-3 seconds; near real-time location updates.
*   **Scalability:** Support 100,000 concurrent users; significant yearly growth in listings and tracking tags.
*   **Reliability:** High availability for all services; tracking accuracy within 3 meters.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive interface, no training required.
