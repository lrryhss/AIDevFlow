## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Cat Travel Logistics component. This component is designed to simplify the process of preparing for cat travel by providing a seamless, in-app solution for renting or purchasing compliant travel containers. The feature aims to reduce the stress and uncertainty cat owners face when trying to find carriers that meet specific airline or travel regulations.

The primary business goal is to create a new revenue stream while enhancing the app's utility as an all-in-one travel solution for cat owners. By integrating logistics directly into the travel planning flow, we can provide convenience and ensure a higher standard of safety and compliance for the traveling cat.

## Key Features

- **Compliance Information**: Detailed information on each container, specifying which airline standards it meets (e.g., IATA compliant).
- **Seamless Transactions**: A clear and secure process for selecting, paying for, and arranging delivery or pickup of containers.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking of container availability for rentals to prevent double-booking.
- **Order History**: Users can view their past and current rental or purchase orders.
