# CatTravelLogistics: Integration Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document provides guidance on integrating the Cat Travel Logistics component with the required external third-party systems.

## 2. Integration with Payment Gateway

- **Purpose**: To securely process payments for container rentals and purchases.
- **Integration Method**: The frontend will use the payment gateway's SDK or a webview to collect payment information. The backend (Logistics Service) will interact with the gateway's API to create payment intents and handle callbacks.
- **Frontend**: The frontend will receive a `payment_intent_client_secret` from the backend and use it to initialize the payment flow with the gateway. This ensures that sensitive card data is never sent to our servers.
- **Backend**: The backend will listen for webhook callbacks from the payment gateway to get the final status of transactions. This endpoint must be secured and only accessible by the gateway.
- **Authentication**: The backend will use API keys to authenticate with the payment gateway.

## 3. Integration with Inventory Management System

- **Purpose**: To ensure the availability of containers is accurately reflected in the app.
- **Integration Method**: The Logistics Service will make synchronous API calls to the Inventory Management System.
- **API Endpoints (to be consumed by our service)**:
    - `GET /inventory/{item_id}/stock`: To check the current stock level for a purchasable item.
    - `GET /inventory/{item_id}/availability?start_date=...&end_date=...`: To check the availability of a rental item for a given date range.
    - `POST /inventory/reserve`: To temporarily reserve an item during the checkout process.
    - `POST /inventory/confirm_order`: To confirm a sale or rental, which will update the inventory levels.
- **Authentication**: The Logistics Service will use an API key to authenticate with the Inventory Management System.
- **Error Handling**: If the Inventory Management System is unavailable, the Logistics Service should gracefully handle the error, for example, by temporarily disabling the ability to order items.
