# CatTravelLogistics: Security Practices

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security practices for the Cat Travel Logistics component, with a strong focus on protecting payment information and user data. All practices must align with the [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md).

## 2. Payment Security

- **PCI Compliance**: The most critical security aspect of this component is handling payments. To minimize risk, we will not process or store any credit card information on our servers. All payment processing will be delegated to a certified, PCI-compliant third-party Payment Gateway.
- **Frontend Integration**: The mobile application will use the Payment Gateway's official SDK or a secure webview to collect payment details. This ensures that sensitive data is sent directly to the gateway and never touches our backend systems.
- **Backend Interaction**: The Logistics Service will only handle non-sensitive information, such as payment intents and transaction status notifications.

## 3. Data Security

- **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Data Minimization**: We will only store the necessary information for order fulfillment and history. No sensitive payment data will be stored.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints will be protected and require a valid JWT token.
- **Authorization**: Users will only be able to access their own order history.

## 5. Secure Coding

- **Dependency Scanning**: The CI/CD pipeline will scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools will be used to analyze the code for security flaws.
- **Secret Management**: All secrets (API keys for the payment gateway and inventory system) will be stored in a secure vault.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: All order and transaction events will be logged for auditing purposes.
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Logs will not contain any PII or payment information.
