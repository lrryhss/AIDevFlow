# Cat Travel App: Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the master testing strategy for the Cat Travel App, ensuring a consistent and high standard of quality across all components.

## 2. Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid model:

- **Unit Tests (Base)**: The largest number of tests. They are fast, isolated, and test individual units of code.
- **Integration Tests (Middle)**: Test the interactions between microservices and with external systems.
- **End-to-End Tests (Top)**: A smaller number of tests that simulate complete user flows through the application.

## 3. Testing Levels

### 3.1 Component-Level Testing
- **Scope**: Each microservice (`Planning`, `Logistics`, `Safety`) has its own comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, as detailed in their respective `09_Testing_Strategy.md` documents.

### 3.2 Application-Level Testing
- **Scope**: Testing the application as a whole.
- **Focus**:
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Verifying that user flows that cross component boundaries work correctly. For example, a user planning a trip (`Planning`) and then renting a container (`Logistics`).
    - **Security Testing**: Application-wide penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
    - **Performance Testing**: Load testing the entire application to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.
    - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: The final stage of testing where stakeholders validate that the application meets the business requirements.

## 4. Test Environments

The application uses a consistent set of environments for all testing activities:

- **Development**: Local developer setups with mocked external services.
- **Testing/QA**: A shared environment that mirrors production, used for running automated integration and E2E tests.
- **Staging**: A pre-production environment for UAT and final validation before a release.
- **Production**: The live environment.

## 5. Automation

- **CI/CD**: All unit and integration tests are run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline for every pull request.
- **Nightly Builds**: A full suite of E2E tests is run every night against the Testing/QA environment to detect regressions early.
