# Cat Travel App: Security Practices

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the overall security posture for the Cat Travel App, ensuring that a consistent and high standard of security is applied across all components. All practices must align with the [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md).

## 2. Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Security is implemented at every layer, from the frontend to the database.
- **Least Privilege**: Users and services are only granted the minimum permissions necessary.
- **Secure by Design**: Security is a core consideration in the design of all new features.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Centralized Authentication**: A dedicated Authentication Service is responsible for user authentication and JWT token generation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: While the current application has a single user role, the system is designed to support RBAC for future expansion.
- **Strict Data Ownership**: All API endpoints enforce that users can only access and manage their own data.

## 4. Data Security

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Special care is taken with sensitive data:
    - **Payment Information**: Handled exclusively by a PCI-compliant third-party gateway.
    - **Location Data**: Stored securely, with access strictly controlled and logged.

## 5. Secure Development Lifecycle

- **Automated Security Testing**: The CI/CD pipeline includes SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning to automatically detect vulnerabilities.
- **Secret Management**: All secrets are stored in a secure vault and are never hardcoded in the application.
- **Regular Penetration Testing**: The application will undergo regular penetration testing by an external security team.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

- **Comprehensive Auditing**: All significant events, especially those related to security and data access, are logged for auditing purposes.
- **Security Alerting**: Automated alerts are in place to detect and respond to suspicious activity in real-time.
