**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

This document provides guidance on integrating the Cat Travel Planning component with the required external third-party systems.

## 2. Integration with Accommodation Booking APIs

- **Purpose**: To source a list of accommodations and their pet policies.
- **Integration Method**: The Planning Service will make synchronous, server-to-server API calls to the external accommodation providers.
- **Data Format**: The Planning Service will be responsible for transforming the data from various external APIs into a standardized format that can be used by the mobile client.
- **Authentication**: The Planning Service will use API keys to authenticate with the accommodation booking APIs.
- **Error Handling**: If an external API is unavailable, the service should return a graceful error to the user. Cached results may be served if available.
- **Data Caching**: Due to the potential cost and rate limiting of external APIs, search results will be cached in Redis with a short TTL (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to reduce the number of calls for popular searches.
