## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Cat Travel Planning component. The focus is on ensuring the accuracy of information and the reliability of the planning tools.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual functions and classes within the Planning Service.
- **Tools**: Pytest.
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage.
- **Focus**: Testing business logic, such as checklist management and data transformation from external APIs.

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interactions between the Planning Service, the database, the cache, and mocked external accommodation APIs.
- **Tools**: Pytest with test containers and mocks.
- **Focus**: Verifying that the service correctly caches data, interacts with the database, and handles various responses from the external APIs.

### 2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Scope**: The complete user flow of planning a trip.
- **Tools**: Detox or Appium.
- **Focus**: Simulating a user searching for an accommodation, creating a checklist, and viewing regulatory guidance.

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1 Functional Testing
- **Objective**: To verify that the planning tools work as expected.
- **Method**: A combination of unit, integration, and E2E tests.

### 3.2 Performance Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the accommodation search is fast and responsive.
- **Tools**: Locust or k6.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Load Testing**: Simulate a large number of concurrent users searching for accommodations.
    - **Cache Testing**: Verify that the caching mechanism is working correctly and improving performance.

### 3.3 Usability Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the planning features are intuitive and helpful.
- **Method**: User testing sessions focused on the trip planning process.

## 4. Test Environments

- **Development**: Local developer machines with mocked external services.
- **Testing/QA**: A dedicated environment with sandboxed versions of the external accommodation APIs.
- **Staging**: A pre-production environment for final validation and UAT.
- **Production**: The live environment.
