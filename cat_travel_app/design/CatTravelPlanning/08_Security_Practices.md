# CatTravelPlanning: Security Practices

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security practices for the Cat Travel Planning component. All practices must align with the [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md).

## 2. Data Security

- **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Data Minimization**: We will only store the data necessary for the functioning of the checklists and for providing regulatory guidance.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints will be protected and require a valid JWT token.
- **Authorization**: Users will only be able to access and manage their own checklists.

## 4. Secure Coding

- **Dependency Scanning**: The CI/CD pipeline will scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools will be used to analyze the code for security flaws.
- **Secret Management**: All secrets (API keys for the accommodation booking APIs) will be stored in a secure vault.

## 5. Third-Party Integrations

- **API Key Security**: API keys for external services will be stored securely and rotated regularly.
- **Data Validation**: All data received from external APIs will be validated before being processed or displayed to the user.
