## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design of the components within the Cat Travel Planning system. It focuses on the responsibilities of the Planning Service.

## 2. Planning Service

- **Description**: The central microservice for all travel planning functionalities.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - **Accommodation Search**: 
        - Receives search requests from the client.
        - Queries the Redis cache for existing results.
        - If no results are cached, it calls the external Accommodation Booking APIs.
        - It filters the results to only include cat-friendly properties.
        - It stores the results in the cache with a short TTL (Time To Live) to ensure data freshness.
    - **Checklist Management**:
        - Provides CRUD operations for travel checklists and their items.
        - Stores and retrieves checklist data from the PostgreSQL database.
    - **Regulatory Guidance**:
        - Provides an API to retrieve regulatory information based on travel destination and transport type.
        - This data is stored in the database and periodically updated.
- **API Endpoints**:
    - `GET /accommodations/search`: Searches for cat-friendly accommodations.
    - `GET /checklists`: Retrieves all checklists for the authenticated user.
    - `POST /checklists`: Creates a new checklist.
    - `PUT /checklists/{checklist_id}`: Updates a checklist.
    - `DELETE /checklists/{checklist_id}`: Deletes a checklist.
    - `GET /guidance`: Retrieves regulatory guidance.
- **Dependencies**: PostgreSQL, Redis, external Accommodation Booking APIs.

## 3. Mobile Application (Client)
