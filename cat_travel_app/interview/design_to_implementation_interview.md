✦ I have read the prompt and am ready to act as the AI agent described.

  To proceed, I need the following information:

  Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the design documents (e.g., cat_travel_app/design/).

  Please also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the unit test XML files (e.g., cat_travel_app/tests/unit/).

  Optionally, you can also provide the paths to the requirements and user stories folders.

✦ Thank you. I have the necessary folder paths:
   * Design: cat_travel_app\design
   * Unit Tests: cat_travel_app\tests\unit
   * Requirements: cat_travel_app\requirements

  I will now study the documents in these locations.

  Which [Project/Module Name] would you like me to generate an implementation plan and guides for? The available components are:
   * CatSafetyMonitoring
   * CatTravelLogistics
   * CatTravelPlanning
   * CatTravelApp (for the overall application)

✦ Excellent. I will generate a comprehensive implementation plan that covers all three core components: CatSafetyMonitoring, CatTravelLogistics, and CatTravelPlanning.

  To ensure a logical and efficient development workflow, I will create a single, unified phased implementation plan for the entire CatTravelApp. This master plan will orchestrate the development of the tasks from all three components, prioritizing foundational   
  work first.

  First, I need to re-read all the documentation for the components to create this unified plan. I will do this one component at a time to ensure I don't miss anything.

  Reading CatSafetyMonitoring documents...
  ✦ I have read the documents for CatSafetyMonitoring. Now I will read the documents for CatTravelLogistics.
  ✦ I have read the documents for CatTravelLogistics. Now I will read the documents for CatTravelPlanning.
  ✦ I have now reviewed all the documentation for the three core components.

  Based on my comprehensive analysis, I propose the following phased implementation plan for the entire CatTravelApp:

  Phased Implementation Plan: CatTravelApp

  Phase 1: Foundational Setup (2 Sprints)

   * Objective: Establish the core infrastructure, shared services, and foundational features for all components.
   * Tasks:
       1. Overall Project Setup: Initialize the monorepo, CI/CD pipeline, and shared configurations.
       2. Database Schemas: Implement the database schemas for all three components (cat_safety, cat_logistics, cat_planning).
       3. User & Cat Services: Implement the shared services for managing user accounts and cat profiles.
       4. Planning Service - Checklists: Implement the core checklist functionality from the CatTravelPlanning component.     
   * Deliverables:
       * A fully configured and automated CI/CD pipeline.
       * All database schemas implemented and tested.
       * Functional User, Cat, and Planning (checklist) services.

  Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (3 Sprints)

   * Objective: Implement the primary features of each component.
   * Tasks:
       1. Logistics Service - Catalog & Orders: Implement the container catalog and order creation logic.
       2. Safety Service - Tag & Location: Implement the tag management and location tracking services.  
       3. Planning Service - Accommodation Search: Implement the accommodation search and integration.   
   * Deliverables:
       * Users can browse and order travel containers.
       * Users can register tracking tags and view their cat's location history.
       * Users can search for cat-friendly accommodations.

  Phase 3: Integration & Real-time Features (2 Sprints)

   * Objective: Integrate external services and implement real-time features.
   * Tasks:
       1. Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate the LogisticsService with the payment gateway.
       2. Geofencing & Notifications: Implement the geofencing logic and push notifications in the SafetyService.
       3. WebSocket Integration: Implement the WebSocket for real-time location updates.
   * Deliverables:
       * A fully functional payment system for logistics.
       * Real-time geofence alerts and notifications.
       * Live location updates on the mobile app.

  I will now begin generating the implementation guides for each task in this plan, starting with Phase 1. I will create a separate guide for each task, and each guide will include a proposed Git branch name that matches its filename.

  I will start with the first task of Phase 1: the overall project setup. I will create the file cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_001_Overall_Project_Setup.xml.
  ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the overall project setup.

  Next, I will create the implementation guide for the second task of Phase 1: setting up the database schemas for all components. I will create the file cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_002_Database_Schemas.xml.

  ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the database schemas.

  Next, I will create the implementation guide for the third task of Phase 1: the shared User and Cat services. I will create the file cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_003_User_Cat_Services.xml.
  ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the User and Cat services.

  Next, I will create the implementation guide for the final task of Phase 1: the checklist functionality of the PlanningService. I will create the file cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_004_Planning_Service_Checklist.xml.

  ✦ I have created the implementation guide for geofencing and notifications.

  Finally, I will create the implementation guide for the last task of Phase 3: WebSocket integration. I will create the file cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P3_003_WebSocket_Integration.xml.
