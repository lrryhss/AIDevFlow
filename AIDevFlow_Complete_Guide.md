Use this comprehensive prompt:

```markdown
## Prompt: Generate User Stories from Interview

Based on our idea exploration for [project name], create comprehensive user stories 
using both the XML and Markdown templates provided in the AIDevFlow documentation.

For each core feature identified, create:

1. **Epic-level story** for the overall feature
2. **Feature stories** breaking down the epic
3. **Technical stories** for infrastructure needs
4. **Edge case stories** for error handling

Use this structure for each story:
- Follow User_Story_Template.md for Markdown stories
- Include Mermaid diagrams for flows
- Add acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then
- Include technical considerations
- Define business rules
- Specify UI/UX requirements

Start with the highest priority feature: [Feature Name]

Format: Create both simple overview and detailed story.
```

### 4.2 Story Generation Example

The AI will generate stories like:

```markdown
# User Story: User Registration and Authentication

**Story ID:** US-AUTH-001  
**Epic:** User Management  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Points:** 8  

## Story Card

**As a** new visitor to the platform  
**I want** to create an account and log in securely  
**So that** I can access personalized features and save my data

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Registration Flow ⭐ Must Have
**Given** I am on the registration page  
**When** I fill in valid email, password, and required details  
**Then** My account should be created  
**And** I should receive a verification email  
**And** I should be logged in automatically  

### AC-2: Email Verification ⭐ Must Have
**Given** I have registered but not verified my email  
**When** I click the verification link in the email  
**Then** My email should be marked as verified  
**And** I should see a success message  

## User Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B{New User?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Registration Form]
    B -->|No| D[Login Form]
    C --> E[Fill Details]
    E --> F{Valid?}
    F -->|No| G[Show Errors]
    G --> E
    F -->|Yes| H[Create Account]
    H --> I[Send Verification Email]
    I --> J[Auto Login]
    J --> K[Dashboard]
```

## Technical Considerations

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for session management
- Email service integration (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- Rate limiting on registration endpoint
- CAPTCHA for bot prevention
```

### 4.3 Story Refinement Process

```markdown

    style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

## 2. Phase 1: Sharing Your Vision

*Time: 15-20 minutes*

This is where the magic begins! You'll share your idea and all supporting materials with the AI, creating a shared understanding of what you want to build.

### Step 1: Present Your Core Idea

Start with the basics. Don't worry about being perfect—just communicate naturally:

**You say:**
```
I want to build [what], because [why]. It will help [who] to [do what].
```

**Example:**
```
I want to build a recipe sharing platform, because existing apps don't focus on dietary restrictions. It will help people with allergies to find safe, delicious recipes from a trusted community.
```

### Step 2: Share Your Resources

Now's the time to share any materials you've gathered. The AI can process:

- 📄 **Research papers**: "Here's a study about food allergies: [paste link or key findings]"
- 🖼️ **Images**: "Here's a mockup I sketched: [describe or attach image]"
- 🔗 **URLs**: "Check out this similar app: [URL] - but I want to do X differently"
- 📝 **Documents**: "I have some initial notes: [paste relevant sections]"

**Pro Tip:** 💡 Don't have any resources? No problem! Just describe what's in your head. The AI can help you research and find relevant materials.

### Step 3: Establish Context

Help the AI understand your constraints and preferences:

```
Some additional context:
- Budget: [your budget range]
- Timeline: [when you need it]
- Tech preferences: [any specific technologies]
- Team size: [solo or team info]
- Experience level: [your technical background]
```

### Step 4: Confirm Understanding

Before moving forward, make sure you're aligned:

**AI will respond with something like:**
```
Let me confirm I understand correctly:
- You want to build [summary]
- The main features are [feature list]
- Your target users are [audience]
- Key differentiators are [unique aspects]

Is this accurate? What would you like to add or change?
```

### 🎯 Success Checkpoint

Before moving to Phase 2, ensure:
- ✅ The AI understands your core concept
- ✅ All your resources have been discussed
- ✅ Key terms are defined
- ✅ You feel heard and understood

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Being too vague ("make it cool")
- ❌ Skipping important context
- ❌ Not correcting misunderstandings

## 3. Phase 2: Building the Blueprint

*Time: 15-20 minutes*

Now we'll create a structured outline—think of it as the skeleton of your future documentation.

### Step 1: Request the Outline

**You say:**
```
Now that you understand my vision, can you create a comprehensive outline for this system? Include all major components and features we'll need to document.
```

### Step 2: Review and Refine

The AI will provide an outline like this:

```markdown
# [Your App Name] - System Outline

## 1. Executive Summary
- Purpose and goals
- Key features
- Target users

## 2. Core Features
- Feature 1: [description]
- Feature 2: [description]
- Feature 3: [description]

## 3. System Components
- Frontend application
- Backend API
- Database
- Third-party integrations

[... more sections ...]
```

### Step 3: Fill the Gaps

Ask yourself (and the AI):
- 🤔 "What's missing from this outline?"
- 🎯 "Which features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?"
- 🔧 "Do we need sections for security, performance, or compliance?"

**You might say:**
```
This looks good, but let's add:
- A section on data privacy (GDPR compliance)
- Mobile app considerations
- Offline functionality
```

### Step 4: Prioritize

**You say:**
```
Can you mark each feature as:
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Phase 2
- Future Enhancement

This will help us focus on what to build first.
```

## 4. Phase 3: Defining What to Build

*Time: 20-30 minutes*

This is where we get specific. We'll transform your outline into detailed requirements that developers can actually implement.

### Understanding Requirements Types

Think of requirements as promises to your future users. There are three types:

1. **Functional Requirements** (What it does)
   - "Users can create an account"
   - "The app sends push notifications"

2. **Non-Functional Requirements** (How well it does it)
   - "Pages load in under 2 seconds"
   - "Supports 10,000 concurrent users"

3. **Constraints** (Boundaries and limits)
   - "Must run on iOS 14+"
   - "Budget cannot exceed $50k"

### Step 1: Dive Into Each Feature

For each major feature in your outline:

**You say:**
```
Let's detail the requirements for [Feature Name]. What specific functionality should it include?
```

**AI will help you create:**
```markdown
### Feature: User Authentication
**ID:** FR-001
**Priority:** High (MVP)
**Description:** Users can securely create accounts and log in

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Password must be at least 8 characters
- [ ] Email verification is required
- [ ] Users can reset forgotten passwords
- [ ] Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

**Technical Notes:**
- Use JWT tokens
- Store passwords with bcrypt
- Implement rate limiting on login attempts
```

### Step 2: Define Quality Standards

**You say:**
```
What non-functional requirements should we include for performance, security, and usability?
```

**Example NFRs:**
```markdown
### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load**: 95% of pages load in <2 seconds
- **API Response**: Average response time <200ms
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime

### Security Requirements
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication available
- **Compliance**: GDPR and CCPA compliant
```

### Step 3: Reality Check

**You say:**
```
Given these constraints:
- Budget: $[amount]
- Timeline: [duration]
- Team: [size and skills]

Are these requirements realistic? What should we adjust?
```

### 🎯 Requirements Checklist

For each requirement, verify it's:
- ✅ **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- ✅ **Measurable**: Has success criteria
- ✅ **Achievable**: Realistic given constraints
- ✅ **Relevant**: Supports your goals
- ✅ **Time-bound**: Has a target phase/deadline

## 5. Phase 4: Creating Professional Documentation

*Time: 30-45 minutes*

This is where everything comes together. We'll create the technical documentation that developers need to build your system.

### The Documentation Suite

You'll create several key documents:

1. **Executive Summary** - For stakeholders
2. **System Architecture** - The big picture
3. **Data Model** - Database design
4. **API Specification** - How components communicate
5. **UI/UX Design** - User interface details

### Step 1: System Architecture

**You say:**
```
Based on our requirements, create a system architecture document showing all components and how they interact.
```

**You'll get:**
- Component diagrams
- Technology stack details
- Integration points
- Deployment architecture

### Step 2: Data Model

**You say:**
```
Now let's design the data model. What tables/collections do we need? Show the relationships between entities.
```

**You'll receive:**
- Entity-relationship diagrams
- Table specifications
- Field definitions
- Indexes and constraints

### Step 3: API Design

**You say:**
```
Create API specifications for all the endpoints needed to support our features.
```

**Example output:**
```markdown
### POST /api/auth/register
**Description:** Register a new user account
**Request Body:**
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
**Response (201):**
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}
```

### Step 4: Validation

**You say:**
```
Let's create a traceability matrix to ensure every requirement is covered in our documentation.
```

## 6. Pro Tips and Best Practices

### 🌟 Communication Gold Rules

1. **Be Specific, Not Vague**
   - ❌ "Make the login secure"
   - ✅ "Implement OAuth 2.0 with Google and GitHub providers"

2. **Provide Examples**
   - ❌ "It should handle errors"
   - ✅ "Show a toast notification for network errors, like 'No internet connection. Please try again.'"

3. **Think in User Stories**
   - ❌ "Add a search feature"
   - ✅ "As a user, I want to search recipes by ingredient so I can use what's in my fridge"

### 🎭 The Expert Role-Playing Technique

One of the most powerful techniques is asking the AI to take on specific expertise. This helps you get specialized, professional-grade advice for each aspect of your application.

#### How It Works

Instead of generic questions, frame your requests by giving the AI a specific expert role:

**Basic question:**
```
"How should I design the database?"
```

**Expert role-playing question:**
```
"Given your years of experience as a database architect working with high-traffic applications, how would you design the database schema for this e-commerce platform?"
```

#### Expert Roles for Different Phases

**UI/UX Design:**
```
"As a senior UX designer with expertise in mobile apps, how would you layout the user flow for onboarding new users? Consider best practices for reducing friction and increasing engagement."
```

**Database Architecture:**
```
"With your experience as a database architect who has worked on scalable systems, what would be the optimal database design for handling millions of user profiles with real-time updates?"
```

**Security:**
```
"As a cybersecurity expert who specializes in fintech applications, what security measures would you implement for handling sensitive payment information?"
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```
"Given your background as a performance engineer at major tech companies, how would you architect this system to handle 100,000 concurrent users?"
```

**API Design:**
```
"As a senior backend engineer who has designed RESTful APIs for Fortune 500 companies, how would you structure the API endpoints for this social media platform?"
```

#### Examples in Action

**Example 1 - UI Flow Discussion:**
```

AI: "As a UI expert, I'd recommend a bottom navigation pattern with these considerations:
1. **Primary Action Float**: A prominent '+' FAB for quick workout logging
2. **Dashboard First**: Home screen shows today's progress at a glance
3. **Gesture Navigation**: Swipe between daily, weekly, monthly views
4. **Social Integration**: Stories-style circles at top for friend updates
[detailed mockup description follows...]"
```

**Example 2 - Database Design:**
```
You: "With your expertise as a database architect who has worked on e-commerce platforms handling Black Friday traffic, how should I structure the database for my inventory management system?"

AI: "Based on my experience with high-traffic e-commerce systems, here's the approach:
1. **Separate Read/Write Databases**: Use primary-replica setup
2. **Inventory Table Partitioning**: Partition by category for faster queries
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis for hot inventory items
4. **Event Sourcing**: Track all inventory changes for audit trail
[detailed schema design follows...]"
```

#### When to Use Expert Roles

- **Architecture Decisions**: "As a solutions architect..."

- **API Design**: "As an API architect..."

#### Pro Tips for Expert Role-Playing

1. **Be Specific About Experience**
   - "With 10 years in fintech..."
   - "Having worked at scale with millions of users..."
   - "Specializing in React Native apps..."

2. **Reference Industry Context**
   - "Following HIPAA compliance standards..."
   - "Using enterprise-grade patterns..."
   - "Considering startup budget constraints..."

3. **Ask for Reasoning**
   - "Why would you choose this approach?"
   - "What trade-offs are we making?"
   - "What alternatives did you consider?"

4. **Layer Multiple Experts**
   ```
   "First, as a UX designer, give me the ideal user flow. 
   Then, as a security expert, identify potential vulnerabilities in that flow."
   ```

This technique transforms generic advice into specialized, professional guidance tailored to your specific needs.
