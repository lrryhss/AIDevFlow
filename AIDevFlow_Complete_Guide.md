# AI Dev Flow: The Missing Manual

## Introduction: "There has to be a better way!"

Ever felt like developing software is like building a house of cards in a wind tunnel? You spend ages planning, designing, and coding, only for a small change or a missed detail to bring things tumbling down. It's slow, it's frustrating, and it often feels like you're reinventing the wheel for every project.

That's where the **AI Dev Flow** comes in.

Think of it as your GPS for software development. It's a structured, step-by-step process that leverages the power of AI to guide you from a rough idea to a fully functional, tested application. It’s designed to make development faster, more consistent, and a whole lot less painful.

**Why should you care?**

*   **Speed:** Stop staring at a blank page. The AI Dev Flow gives you a clear path forward at every stage.
*   **Consistency:** No more "making it up as you go." Every project follows the same proven structure, making it easier for anyone to jump in and contribute.
*   **Quality:** By building on a solid foundation of requirements and design, you catch errors early and build more robust applications.
*   **AI-Powered:** It’s designed from the ground up to be used with AI assistants (like me!), turning them into powerful collaborators.

Ready to get started? Let's walk through the process step-by-step.

## The 5 Steps of AI Dev Flow

The entire process is broken down into five simple, logical stages. We'll go from the big picture idea all the way down to the nitty-gritty code.

### Step 1: Laying the Foundation (The Principles)

Before you build a house, you need to understand the principles of architecture. The same goes for software. This first step is about understanding the "why" behind the process.

*   **What to do:** Read through the core principles of the AI Dev Flow.

*   **Why it's important:** These principles are the bedrock of the entire system. Understanding them will help you make better decisions throughout the development process.

*   **Find them here:** `1_principles/`

### Step 2: Creating Your Blueprints (The Templates)

Every great construction project starts with a blueprint. In software, our blueprints are user stories and requirements. This step is about defining what we're going to build.

*   **What to do:** Familiarize yourself with the templates for user stories, requirements, and more.

*   **Why it's important:** Templates ensure that you capture all the necessary information in a consistent, structured way. No more guessing what a feature is supposed to do.

*   **Find them here:** `2_templates/`

### Step 3: The "How-To" Manual (The Guides)

This is the heart of the AI Dev Flow. These guides provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire development process, from turning an initial idea into a concrete plan, to writing the code.

*   **What to do:** Follow the guides in order. They will show you how to:
    1.  Turn an interview or idea into **User Stories**. (`3.1_interview_to_stories.md`)
    2.  Flesh out User Stories into detailed **Requirements**. (`3.2_stories_to_requirements.md`)
    3.  Create a **Design** from your Requirements. (`3.3_requirements_to_design.md`)
    4.  Use the design to **Implement** the code. (`3.4_implementation_guide_usage.md`)
    5.  Write **Unit Tests** to ensure everything works. (`3.5_unit_test_implementation.md`)

*   **Why it's important:** This is your main roadmap. It takes the guesswork out of development and ensures you don't miss a critical step.

*   **Find them here:** `3_guides/`

### Step 4: See It In Action (The Examples)

Theory is great, but seeing is believing. The examples show you what the finished products of each stage look like in the real world.

*   **What to do:** Look through the examples to see how the principles, templates, and guides come together.

*   **Why it's important:** Examples make the abstract concepts concrete and provide a clear target to aim for.

*   **Find them here:** `4_examples/`

### Step 5: Your AI Super-Charger (The Reference)

The AI Dev Flow is designed to be used with an AI assistant. This section contains ready-to-use prompts to help you get the most out of your AI collaborator.

*   **What to do:** Use these prompts when you're working with your AI to speed up the development process.

*   **Why it's important:** These prompts are engineered to get high-quality, structured responses from AI, saving you time and effort.

*   **Find them here:** `5_reference/`

### AI Prompts by Role

To further assist with AI-driven development, specific prompt guides are available for various roles within a software development team. These guides provide tailored prompts to help each role leverage AI effectively in their daily tasks.

*   **Find them here:** `5_reference/roles/`

## Why Bother? The Secret to Building Enterprise-Grade Software

You might be thinking, "This seems like a lot of steps. Can't I just start coding?" You can, but if you're building serious, long-lasting enterprise software, skipping these steps is like building a skyscraper on a foundation of sand. Here’s why each piece is critical:

### Why User Stories? (So you build the *right* thing)

*   **The Problem:** Developers build features that work perfectly but don't solve the actual user's problem.

*   **The Solution:** User stories force you to think from the perspective of the end-user. They anchor every feature to a real-world need and a business goal.

*   **Enterprise Advantage:** In a large organization, stories ensure that development work is always aligned with stakeholder needs and business value, preventing wasted effort on features nobody will use.

### Why Requirements? (So you build the thing *right*)

*   **The Problem:** A feature is built, but it's missing key details, handles errors poorly, or doesn't work the way the user expected. Ambiguity leads to endless rework.

*   **The Solution:** Requirements are the "contract" for a feature. They translate the high-level story into a detailed, unambiguous specification. What happens if the user enters invalid data? What are the exact performance criteria? Requirements answer these questions *before* a single line of code is written.

*   **Enterprise Advantage:** In complex systems where multiple teams and components interact, precise requirements are the only way to ensure everything fits together. They are the single source of truth that prevents miscommunication and integration nightmares.

### Why Design Documents? (So you have a map before you build)

*   **The Problem:** Developers start coding without a plan. They might choose the wrong tools, create inefficient data structures, or build components that are difficult to connect. This leads to major refactoring and delays down the road.

*   **The Solution:** A design document is the architectural blueprint. It translates the *what* (Requirements) into the *how*. It outlines the high-level structure, component interactions, database schemas, and API contracts. It's where you think through the hard problems before writing code.

*   **Enterprise Advantage:** For large systems, a solid design is non-negotiable. It ensures scalability, security, and performance are considered from the start. It allows teams to work in parallel on different components with confidence that they will integrate correctly.

### Why Implementation Guides? (So your software can last)

*   **The Problem:** The codebase becomes a "spaghetti" mess that only the original developer understands. It's impossible to maintain, update, or onboard new team members.

*   **The Solution:** An implementation guide is the detailed, low-level plan for a specific component, based on the high-level design. It defines the specific classes, methods, and coding patterns to be followed, ensuring the code is clean, consistent, and understandable.

*   **Enterprise Advantage:** Enterprise applications live for years, or even decades. A clear implementation guide is essential for long-term maintainability, scalability, and reducing the "bus factor" (where knowledge is stuck in one person's head).

### Why Unit Tests? (So you can change things without fear)

*   **The Problem:** You fix a bug in one place, and it mysteriously breaks two other things. You're afraid to refactor or improve the code because you might break something.

*   **The Solution:** Unit tests are a safety net. They are small, automated tests that verify that each individual piece of the code works exactly as expected. When you make a change, you can run the tests instantly to confirm that you haven't broken anything.

*   **Enterprise Advantage:** For mission-critical enterprise systems, bugs can have catastrophic financial or security implications. Unit tests are the first line of defense. They are fundamental to modern practices like Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and allow the system to evolve safely over time.

## Putting It All Together: The Cat Travel App Case Study

To make this concrete, let's walk through a real-world example using our exciting new **Cat Travel App** as the running case study. We'll demonstrate how the AI Dev Flow guides us from an initial idea to detailed user stories, and then conceptually through the subsequent stages.

### Example 1: From Idea to User Story (Finding Purr-fect Stays)

We started with a simple idea: a travel app for cats. We then used an AI interviewer to elicit more details.

**The Prompt Used to Start the Interview:**
```
Please read the content of `5_reference/5.2_idea_interview_prompt.md` and then act as the AI interviewer as described in the prompt.
```

**The Interview Prompt Used:**
```markdown
Act as an AI interviewer for a new software idea. Your goal is to elicit detailed information to help define the core concept and initial requirements.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Introduction**: Briefly explain your role as the interviewer and the purpose of this session (to gather information for defining a new software idea).
2.  **Core Idea**: Ask me to describe my new software idea in a few sentences.
3.  **Problem/Opportunity**: Ask me:
    *   What specific problem does this software solve?
    *   What opportunity does it address?
    *   Who experiences this problem/opportunity?
4.  **Target Users**: Ask me to describe the primary target users. What are their roles, goals, and pain points related to this idea?
5.  **Key Features**: Ask me to list the top 3-5 essential features this software *must* have to solve the problem or seize the opportunity.
6.  **Value Proposition**: Ask me: What is the unique value this software provides to its users? Why would they choose it over alternatives (if any)?
7.  **Non-Functional Considerations**: Briefly touch upon any initial thoughts on non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, scalability, usability).
8.  **Next Steps**: Conclude by stating that based on my responses, you will then generate initial user stories.

Throughout the interview, ask follow-up questions to clarify my responses and dig deeper, as outlined in the "Requirements Elicitation" activities of the [Phase 1: Requirements Discovery and Analysis SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_1_requirements_discovery_analysis_sop.md).

Once the interview is complete, summarize the key points and then, using the principles from [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) and the [User Story Markdown Template](../../2_templates/2.1_user_story.md), generate 3-5 initial user stories based on our conversation.
```

**The Interview Transcript:**
You can review the full interview transcript here: [cat_travel_app/interview/catapp_interview_1.md](cat_travel_app/interview/catapp_interview_1.md)

**AI Output (Initial User Stories):**
Based on the interview, the AI generated the following initial user stories, saved in the `cat_travel_app/user_stories/` directory:

*   [US-CAT-001: Find Cat-Friendly Accommodations](cat_travel_app/user_stories/2.1_user_story_cat_travel_1.md)
*   [US-CAT-002: Cat Travel Checklist & Guidance](cat_travel_app/user_stories/2.1_user_story_cat_travel_2.md)
*   [US-CAT-003: Cat Travel Container Management](cat_travel_app/user_stories/2.1_user_story_cat_travel_3.md)
*   [US-CAT-004: Cat Tracking Tag Integration](cat_travel_app/user_stories/2.1_user_story_cat_travel_4.md)

### Example 2: From Multiple User Stories to Comprehensive Requirements (The Great Cat-inerary)

Now that we have initial user stories, the next step is to consolidate them into detailed requirements.

**The Prompt Used to Start Requirements Generation:**
```
Please read the content of `5_reference/5.3_stories_to_requirements_prompt.md` and then act as the AI agent described in the prompt.
```

**The Interaction:**

**AI:** ✦ I have read the content of `5_reference/5.3_stories_to_requirements_prompt.md`. Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

**User:** `cat_travel_app\user_stories`

**AI Output (Conceptual):**
Based on the user stories in `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`, the AI analyzed the content and proposed a logical organization structure for the requirements, then generated separate XML files for each epic/feature area. These files are located in `cat_travel_app/requirements/`:

*   [cat_safety_monitoring_requirements.xml](cat_travel_app/requirements/cat_safety_monitoring_requirements.xml)
*   [cat_travel_logistics_requirements.xml](cat_travel_app/requirements/cat_travel_logistics_requirements.xml)
*   [cat_travel_planning_requirements.xml](cat_travel_app/requirements/cat_travel_planning_requirements.xml)

### Example 3: From Requirements to Design (The Purr-fect Design)

With clear requirements, we can now create the high-level architectural design for the Cat Travel App, organized by its core components.

**The Prompt Used to Start Design Generation:**
```
Please read the content of `5_reference/5.4_requirements_to_design_prompt.md` and then act as the AI agent described in the prompt.
```

**The Interaction:**

**AI:** ✦ Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`).

**User:** `cat_travel_app\requirements`

**AI:** ✦ Thank you. I have the requirements folder path: `cat_travel_app\requirements`.

Do you want to provide the absolute path to the folder containing the user stories as well?

Once you provide that (or if you choose to skip it), I will study the requirements (and user stories, if provided).

What is the `[Project/Module Name]` for which you need the design?

I will propose the following output path for the new design documents: `cat_travel_app\design`. Please confirm if this is acceptable.

**User:** `cat_travel_app`

**AI:** ✦ Understood. Project: `cat_travel_app`.

I will proceed using only the requirements from `cat_travel_app/requirements` and output the design to `cat_travel_app/design`.

Now, I will analyze the requirements to propose a logical structure for the design documentation.

**AI:** ✦ Based on my analysis of the requirements files, I propose structuring the design documentation into the following logical components:

*   CatSafetyMonitoring
*   CatTravelLogistics
*   CatTravelPlanning

Now, to ensure I follow the project's standards, I will read `1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md` to determine the precise directory and file structure for these components.

**AI:** ✦ I have read and understood the design principles.

Based on the logical components and the `1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md` document, I will create the following directory and file structure under `cat_travel_app/design/`:

```
cat_travel_app/design/
├── CatSafetyMonitoring/

    ├── 07_Development_Guide.md
    ├── 08_Security_Practices.md
    └── 09_Testing_Strategy.md
```

Please confirm if this file structure is acceptable.

Once you confirm, I will read all the necessary documentation to ensure I adhere to all standards before generating the design documents.

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** Excellent. I will now read and internalize all the required documentation to ensure the design documents are of the highest quality and adhere to all project standards. This includes the design principles, Mermaid syntax guide, relevant SOPs, style guides, and best practices.

I will then begin by generating the complete set of design documents for the CatSafetyMonitoring component. This will be a comprehensive process, and I will notify you upon completion.

**AI:** ✦ I have successfully generated the complete set of design documents for the CatTravelLogistics component. The documents are located in the `cat_travel_app/design/CatTravelLogistics/` directory.

Would you like me to proceed with generating the design documents for the final component, CatTravelPlanning?

**AI:** ✦ I have successfully generated the complete set of design documents for the CatTravelPlanning component. The documents are located in the `cat_travel_app/design/CatTravelPlanning/` directory.

This concludes the generation of all design documentation for the `cat_travel_app` project as requested. The design documents for all three components—CatSafetyMonitoring, CatTravelLogistics, and CatTravelPlanning—are now available in their respective subdirectories under `cat_travel_app/design/`.

**User:** `now create a set of highlevel documents for the following the same standers. this covering the app has a whole`

**AI:** ✦ Of course. I will now create a set of high-level design documents for the `cat_travel_app` as a whole, following the same standards.

To keep these separate from the component-specific designs, I will create a new directory: `cat_travel_app/design/CatTravelApp/`.

I will adapt the standard document set to provide a high-level, application-wide perspective. The following documents will be created:

*   `00_Executive_Summary.md`: A summary of the entire application.
*   `01_System_Architecture.md`: An overarching architecture showing how the CatSafetyMonitoring, CatTravelLogistics, and CatTravelPlanning components interact.
*   `02_Data_Model.md`: A high-level data model illustrating the relationships between the different component schemas.
*   `05_UI_UX_Design.md`: A general overview of the application's UI/UX and the flow between the main features.
*   `08_Security_Practices.md`: A document outlining the overall security posture of the application.
*   `09_Testing_Strategy.md`: The master testing strategy for the entire application.

Documents like `03_Component_Design`, `04_API_Specification`, `06_Integration_Guide`, and `07_Development_Guide` are more detailed at the component level and will be omitted here to avoid redundancy.

Do you approve of this plan?

**User:** `yes`

**AI Output (Generated Design Documents):**

Based on the confirmed structure and adherence to design principles, the AI generated the following design documents, organized into their respective component subdirectories under `cat_travel_app/design/`:

*   **CatSafetyMonitoring Component:**

### Example 4: From Design to Comprehensive Unit Tests (Ensuring the Tracking is Flawless)

Before even writing the implementation, we can generate a robust set of unit tests based on the requirements and design, ensuring test-driven development (TDD) principles are followed. Let's focus on the "Cat Tracking Tag Integration" module.

**The Prompt Used to Start Unit Test Generation:**
```
Please read the content of `5_reference/5.5_design_to_unit_tests_prompt.md` and then act as the AI agent described in the prompt.
```

**The Interaction:**

**AI:** ✦ Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`) and the original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

**User:** `cat_travel_app\design,cat_travel_app\requirements`

**AI:** ✦ Thank you. I have the design folder path: `cat_travel_app\design` and the requirements folder path: `cat_travel_app\requirements`.

I will study the documents in these locations.

Which `[Component/Module Name]` would you like me to generate unit tests for? The available components are:

*   CatSafetyMonitoring
*   CatTravelLogistics
*   CatTravelPlanning
*   CatTravelApp (for high-level application tests)

I will propose the following output path for the new unit test files: `cat_travel_app/tests/unit`. Please confirm if this is acceptable.

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** ✦ Understood. The output path `cat_travel_app/tests/unit` is confirmed.

Please specify which component you'd like me to generate unit tests for first. The available components are:

*   CatSafetyMonitoring
*   CatTravelLogistics
*   CatTravelPlanning
*   CatTravelApp

Shall I start with CatSafetyMonitoring?

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** ✦ Excellent. I will begin with the CatSafetyMonitoring component.

First, I will study the design documents, requirements, and all relevant testing standards to ensure the generated unit tests are comprehensive and adhere to the project's conventions. This is a crucial step to guarantee the quality and completeness of the tests.

I will now read the necessary documentation.

**AI:** ✦ I have read and internalized all the provided documentation. I am now ready to generate the design documents for the CatSafetyMonitoring component, adhering to all the specified standards and best practices.

Based on my analysis, I will structure the unit tests by focusing on the individual microservices defined in the component design:

*   Tag Management Service: Tests for tag registration, status updates, and battery level monitoring.
*   Location Service: Tests for location data ingestion, processing, and history retrieval.
*   Geofence Service: Tests for geofence CRUD operations and breach evaluation.
*   Notification Service: Tests for alert formatting and integration with the push notification service mock.

For each service, I will create a series of test case files in the `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/` directory. Each file will cover a specific feature or scenario, such as `tag_management_registration.xml`, `location_service_history.xml`, etc.

This structure will ensure that the tests are organized, easy to maintain, and directly correspond to the component's architecture.

Do you approve of this plan?

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** ✦ Excellent. I will now begin generating the unit tests for the CatSafetyMonitoring component, starting with the TagManagementService.

My first test case will cover the successful registration of a new tracking tag. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/tag_management_registration_positive.xml` with the detailed test definition.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the unit test for the NotificationService.

This completes the initial set of unit tests for the CatSafetyMonitoring component, covering positive and negative scenarios for the key services.

Would you like me to proceed with generating unit tests for the next component, CatTravelLogistics?

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** ✦ Excellent. I will now proceed with generating unit tests for the CatTravelLogistics component.

As before, I will first study the design and requirements documents for this specific component to ensure the tests are accurate and comprehensive.

**AI:** ✦ I have reviewed the design and requirements for the CatTravelLogistics component.

I will structure the unit tests to cover the core functionalities of the LogisticsService:

*   Catalog Management: Tests for retrieving the container catalog.
*   Order Processing: Tests for creating purchase and rental orders.
*   Payment Handling: Tests for handling payment gateway callbacks.

I will start by creating a test case for successfully retrieving the list of available containers for purchase. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatTravelLogistics/logistics_service_get_catalog_positive.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the negative test case for an out-of-stock order.

This completes the initial set of unit tests for the CatTravelLogistics component.

Would you like me to proceed with generating unit tests for the final component, CatTravelPlanning?

**User:** `yes`

**AI:** ✦ Excellent. I will now proceed with generating unit tests for the CatTravelPlanning component.

I will begin by studying the design and requirements documents for this component to ensure the tests are accurate and comprehensive.

**AI:** ✦ I have reviewed the design and requirements for the CatTravelPlanning component.

I will structure the unit tests to cover the core functionalities of the PlanningService:

*   Accommodation Search: Tests for searching for cat-friendly accommodations and handling cached results.
*   Checklist Management: Tests for creating, retrieving, and updating travel checklists.

I will start by creating a test case for successfully searching for cat-friendly accommodations. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatTravelPlanning/planning_service_search_accommodations_positive.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the positive test case for creating a checklist.

Finally, I will create a negative test case to handle the scenario where a user tries to add a checklist item with an empty name. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatTravelPlanning/planning_service_add_checklist_item_invalid.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the negative test case for adding an invalid checklist item.

This completes the generation of unit tests for all three components: CatSafetyMonitoring, CatTravelLogistics, and CatTravelPlanning. The test files are located in their respective subdirectories under `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/`.

**AI Output (Generated Unit Test Files):**

Based on the confirmed structure and adherence to testing principles, the AI generated the following unit test XML files, organized into their respective component subdirectories under `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/`:

*   **CatSafetyMonitoring Component:**
    *   [geofence_service_creation_invalid_radius.xml](cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/geofence_service_creation_invalid_radius.xml)
    *   [geofence_service_creation_positive.xml](cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/geofence_service_creation_positive.xml)

### Example 5: From Design to Phased Implementation Plan (Mapping the Development Journey)

Now, let's leverage the AI to create a strategic implementation plan, breaking down the entire Cat Travel App project into manageable phases or sprints.

**The Prompt Used to Start Implementation Generation:**
```
Please read the content of `5_reference/5.6_design_to_implementation_prompt.md` and then act as the AI agent described in the prompt.
```

**The Interaction:**

**AI:** ✦ I have read the prompt and am ready to act as the AI agent described.

To proceed, I need the following information:

Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Please also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the unit test XML files (e.g., `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the paths to the requirements and user stories folders.

**User:** `cat_travel_app\design,cat_travel_app\tests\unit,cat_travel_app\requirements`

**AI:** ✦ Thank you. I have the necessary folder paths:

*   Design: `cat_travel_app\design`
*   Unit Tests: `cat_travel_app\tests\unit`
*   Requirements: `cat_travel_app\requirements`

I will now study the documents in these locations.

Which `[Project/Module Name]` would you like me to generate an implementation plan and guides for? The available components are:

*   CatSafetyMonitoring
*   CatTravelLogistics
*   CatTravelPlanning
*   CatTravelApp (for the overall application)

**User:** `all of them`

**AI:** ✦ Excellent. I will generate a comprehensive implementation plan that covers all three core components: CatSafetyMonitoring, CatTravelLogistics, and CatTravelPlanning.

To ensure a logical and efficient development workflow, I will create a single, unified phased implementation plan for the entire CatTravelApp. This master plan will orchestrate the development of the tasks from all three components, prioritizing foundational work first.

First, I need to re-read all the documentation for the components to create this unified plan. I will do this one component at a time to ensure I don't miss anything.

Reading CatSafetyMonitoring documents...

**AI:** ✦ I have read the documents for CatSafetyMonitoring. Now I will read the documents for CatTravelLogistics.

**AI:** ✦ I have read the documents for CatTravelLogistics. Now I will read the documents for CatTravelPlanning.

**AI:** ✦ I have now reviewed all the documentation for the three core components.

Based on my comprehensive analysis, I propose the following phased implementation plan for the entire CatTravelApp:

```markdown
Phased Implementation Plan: CatTravelApp

Phase 1: Foundational Setup (2 Sprints)

*   Objective: Establish the core infrastructure, shared services, and foundational features for all components.
*   Tasks:
    1. Overall Project Setup: Initialize the monorepo, CI/CD pipeline, and shared configurations.
    2. Database Schemas: Implement the database schemas for all three components (cat_safety, cat_logistics, cat_planning).
    3. User & Cat Services: Implement the shared services for managing user accounts and cat profiles.
    4. Planning Service - Checklists: Implement the core checklist functionality from the CatTravelPlanning component.
*   Deliverables:
    *   A fully configured and automated CI/CD pipeline.
    *   All database schemas implemented and tested.
    *   Functional User, Cat, and Planning (checklist) services.

Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (3 Sprints)

*   Objective: Implement the primary features of each component.
*   Tasks:
    1. Logistics Service - Catalog & Orders: Implement the container catalog and order creation logic.
    2. Safety Service - Tag & Location: Implement the tag management and location tracking services.
    3. Planning Service - Accommodation Search: Implement the accommodation search and integration.
*   Deliverables:
    *   Users can browse and order travel containers.
    *   Users can register tracking tags and view their cat's location history.
    *   Users can search for cat-friendly accommodations.

Phase 3: Integration & Real-time Features (2 Sprints)

*   Objective: Integrate external services and implement real-time features.
*   Tasks:
    1. Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate the LogisticsService with the payment gateway.
    2. Geofencing & Notifications: Implement the geofencing logic and push notifications in the SafetyService.
    3. WebSocket Integration: Implement the WebSocket for real-time location updates.
*   Deliverables:
    *   A fully functional payment system for logistics.
    *   Real-time geofence alerts and notifications.
    *   Live location updates on the mobile app.
```

I will now begin generating the implementation guides for each task in this plan, starting with Phase 1. I will create a separate guide for each task, and each guide will include a proposed Git branch name that matches its filename.

I will start with the first task of Phase 1: the overall project setup. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_001_Overall_Project_Setup.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the overall project setup.

Next, I will create the implementation guide for the second task of Phase 1: setting up the database schemas for all components. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_002_Database_Schemas.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the database schemas.

Next, I will create the implementation guide for the third task of Phase 1: the shared User and Cat services. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_003_User_Cat_Services.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the implementation guide for the User and Cat services.

Next, I will create the implementation guide for the final task of Phase 1: the checklist functionality of the PlanningService. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_004_Planning_Service_Checklist.xml`.

**AI:** ✦ I have created the implementation guide for geofencing and notifications.

Finally, I will create the implementation guide for the last task of Phase 3: WebSocket integration. I will create the file `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P3_003_WebSocket_Integration.xml`.

**AI Output (Generated Implementation Guides):**

Based on the confirmed phased implementation plan, the AI generated the following implementation guides, organized into their respective phase subdirectories under `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/`:

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Setup**

### Example 6: Implementing a Task (Building the Cat Tracking Module)

With the phased plan in hand, we can now instruct the AI to work on a specific task, leveraging all the prior documentation. Let's focus on implementing the core logic for the Cat Tracking Tag Integration.

**Your Prompt:**

> "Let's start working on 'Implement Cat Tracking Tag Integration' from our implementation plan (from Example 5's output). Study the relevant user story [US-CAT-004: Cat Tracking Tag Integration](cat_travel_app/user_stories/2.1_user_story_cat_travel_4.md), the requirements for the Cat Tracking module (assume it's at `cat_travel_app/requirements/tracking_requirements.xml`), the design document for the Cat Tracking service (assume it's at `cat_travel_app/design/tracking_service_design.md`), and the unit tests generated for this module (from Example 4's output). Generate the Python code for the `CatTrackerService` class, including methods for receiving location updates, storing history, and triggering geofence alerts, adhering to the design and requirements. Once the code is generated, run the associated unit tests to verify its correctness. Assume the unit tests are in a file named `test_cat_tracker_service.py`."

**AI Output (Conceptual):**

```python
# cat_tracker_service.py

import datetime

class CatTrackerService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locations = {} # {cat_id: [(timestamp, lat, lon)]}
        self.geofences = {} # {cat_id: {'name': 'home', 'lat': X, 'lon': Y, 'radius': Z}}

    def record_location(self, cat_id: str, lat: float, lon: float):
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        if cat_id not in self.locations:
            self.locations[cat_id] = []
        self.locations[cat_id].append((timestamp, lat, lon))
        print(f"Recorded location for {cat_id}: ({lat}, {lon}) at {timestamp}")
        self._check_geofence(cat_id, lat, lon)

    def get_current_location(self, cat_id: str):
        if cat_id in self.locations and self.locations[cat_id]:
            return self.locations[cat_id][-1]
        return None

    def get_location_history(self, cat_id: str, limit: int = 10):
        if cat_id in self.locations:
            return self.locations[cat_id][-limit:]
        return []

    def set_geofence(self, cat_id: str, name: str, lat: float, lon: float, radius: float):
        self.geofences[cat_id] = {'name': name, 'lat': lat, 'lon': lon, 'radius': radius}
        print(f"Set geofence for {cat_id}: {name} at ({lat}, {lon}) with radius {radius}m")

    def _check_geofence(self, cat_id: str, current_lat: float, current_lon: float):
        if cat_id in self.geofences:
            gf = self.geofences[cat_id]
            # Simple distance check (Haversine formula would be more accurate for real-world)
            distance = ((current_lat - gf['lat'])**2 + (current_lon - gf['lon'])**2)**0.5 * 111000 # Approx meters per degree
            
            if distance > gf['radius']:
                print(f"ALERT: {cat_id} has left geofence '{gf['name']}'!")
            else:
                print(f"{cat_id} is within geofence '{gf['name']}'.")

# ... (other necessary imports and setup for a real service)
```

```bash
# Running unit tests...
