# Standalone JavaScript/Node.js Security Best Practices Guide

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Purpose**: To provide a complete, self-contained security standard for JavaScript/Node.js projects, incorporating enterprise-wide principles.
- **Audience**: JavaScript/Node.js Developers, Security Engineers, Technical Leads

## 1. Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum access rights necessary.
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure that system failures do not compromise security.
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security into every phase of the development lifecycle.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of its origin.

---

## 2. Input Validation and Data Sanitization

- **Validate All Inputs**: Use a schema validation library like `zod` or `joi` for all incoming data (API requests, user forms, etc.).
- **Prevent XSS**: Sanitize all user-supplied data before rendering it in the browser. Use a library like `DOMPurify`.
- **Prevent NoSQL Injection**: If using a NoSQL database like MongoDB, use an ODM (e.g., Mongoose) and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Prevent SQL Injection**: Use an ORM (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM) or a query builder that supports parameterized queries.

---

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Password Security**: Hash passwords using `bcrypt`.
- **MFA**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication using libraries like `speakeasy`.
- **Session Management**: Use a secure session management library (e.g., `express-session` with a secure store) or JWTs with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization models to control access to resources.

---

## 4. Cryptography and Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.3. Configure your Node.js server to use secure cipher suites.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Use the built-in `crypto` module for encryption (AES-256-GCM is recommended).
- **Key Management**: Store encryption keys and other secrets in environment variables or a secure vault, not in the code.

---

## 5. Secure Communication

- **API Security**: Use JWTs or another token-based mechanism for securing APIs. Use libraries like `helmet` to set secure HTTP headers.
- **CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly to only allow requests from trusted domains.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- **Secure Error Handling**: Catch errors gracefully and avoid sending detailed stack traces to the client.
- **Security Logging**: Use a logger like `winston` or `pino` to log security-related events.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**: Never log sensitive information.

---

## 7. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to scan for vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
- **Version Pinning**: Use a lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure deterministic builds.

---

## 8. Security Testing

- **SAST**: Use static analysis tools to find security vulnerabilities in your code.
- **DAST**: Use dynamic analysis tools to test your running application for vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing.
