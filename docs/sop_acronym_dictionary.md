## Additional Technical Terms

**Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
A visual representation of the relationships between entities in a database. ERDs show how database tables relate to each other and are used in database design to ensure data integrity and proper normalization.

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components.

**Quality Gate**
A checkpoint in the software development process where specific criteria must be met before the project can proceed to the next phase. Quality gates ensure that deliverables meet predefined standards for quality, completeness, and approval.

**Penetration Testing**
A simulated cyber attack against a computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is used to evaluate the security of a system and identify potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

**Code Coverage**
A measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. It helps identify areas of code that are not being tested and indicates the quality of the test suite.
