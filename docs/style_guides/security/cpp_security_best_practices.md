# Standalone C++ Security Best Practices Guide

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Purpose**: To provide a complete, self-contained security standard for C++ projects, incorporating enterprise-wide principles.
- **Audience**: C++ Developers, Security Engineers, Technical Leads

---

## 1. Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum access rights necessary.
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure that system failures do not compromise security.
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security into every phase of the development lifecycle.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of its origin.

---

## 2. Input Validation and Data Sanitization

- **Validate All Inputs**: Every input from an external source must be validated before use.
- **Prevent Buffer Overflows**: Use `std::string` and standard library containers instead of raw C-style arrays and pointers. Use safe string functions like `strncpy` with explicit bounds checking if you must use C-style strings.
- **Whitelist, Don't Blacklist**: Define what is allowed, rather than trying to block what is disallowed.
- **Prevent SQL Injection**: Use modern database libraries that support prepared statements and parameterized queries.

---

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Password Security**: Hash passwords using a strong, well-vetted library like `libsodium` or `OpenSSL`'s `EVP` interface for `bcrypt` or `Argon2`.
- **MFA**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all administrative and sensitive accounts.
- **Session Management**: Use secure, cryptographically random session tokens.

---

## 4. Cryptography and Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: Use a mature library like OpenSSL or Boost.Asio with SSL support for TLS 1.3.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Use AES-256 for encrypting sensitive data. Use a library like Crypto++ or OpenSSL.
- **Key Management**: Store keys securely, not in the source code. Use a secure key management system.

---

## 5. Secure Communication

- **API Security**: Secure APIs with standard protocols. Validate all incoming data and authenticate/authorize every request.
- **Certificate Validation**: Always validate server certificates.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- **Secure Error Handling**: Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.
- **Security Logging**: Log all security-sensitive events.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**: Never log passwords, session tokens, or other secrets.

---

## 7. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like `vcpkg` or `conan` with audit capabilities to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Version Pinning**: Lock dependency versions in your build system (e.g., CMake, Conan).

---

## 8. Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for security-critical functions.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Use fuzzing tools to find vulnerabilities in input parsing and processing code.
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Use static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) analysis tools to find security flaws.
