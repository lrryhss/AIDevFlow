# Standalone Java Security Best Practices Guide

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Purpose**: To provide a complete, self-contained security standard for Java projects, incorporating enterprise-wide principles.
- **Audience**: Java Developers, Security Engineers, Technical Leads

---

## 1. Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum access rights necessary.
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure that system failures do not compromise security.
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security into every phase of the development lifecycle.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of its origin.

## 2. Input Validation and Data Sanitization

- **Validate All Inputs**: Every input from an external source must be validated before use.
- **Use a Validation Framework**: Use a standard framework like Jakarta Bean Validation for declarative validation.
- **Whitelist, Don't Blacklist**: Define what is allowed, rather than trying to block what is disallowed.
- **Prevent SQL Injection**: Use `PreparedStatement` with parameterized queries. Never use string concatenation to build SQL queries.

**Example:**
```java
// Good: Parameterized query
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND status = ?";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    stmt.setString(1, email);
    stmt.setBoolean(2, true);
    // ...
}
```

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Password Security**: Hash passwords using a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` with a work factor of at least 12.
- **MFA**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all administrative and sensitive accounts.
- **Session Management**: Use secure, randomly generated session tokens. Invalidate sessions on logout and after a period of inactivity.
- **Authorization**: Use a robust authorization framework like Spring Security to enforce access control based on roles and permissions.

---

## 4. Cryptography and Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Use AES-256 for encrypting sensitive data stored in databases or on the filesystem.
- **Key Management**: Use a `KeyStore` for managing cryptographic keys. Implement a key rotation policy.

---

## 5. Secure Communication

- **API Security**: Secure APIs with a standard like OAuth 2.0 or JWT. Validate all tokens and enforce scopes.
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` in all HTTP responses.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- **Secure Error Handling**: Do not expose internal system details or stack traces in error messages to the user.
- **Security Logging**: Log all security-sensitive events (e.g., login attempts, access control failures, changes to permissions).
- **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**: Never log passwords, session tokens, API keys, or other sensitive information.

---

## 7. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Version Pinning**: Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to lock dependency versions.

---

## 8. Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for security-critical functions like input validation and access control logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Test security controls across different components.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing against the application.
