## 1. Overview

### 1.1 From Requirements to Design

The transformation flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Input Documents"
        US[User Stories]
        REQ[Requirements]
        ADP[Design Principles]
    end
    
    subgraph "Design Documents"
        ARCH[Architecture Design]
        API[API Design]
        DATA[Data Model Design]
        UI[UI/UX Design]
        SEC[Security Design]
        INT[Integration Design]
    end
    
    US --> ARCH
    REQ --> ARCH
    ADP --> ARCH
    
    ARCH --> API
    ARCH --> DATA
    ARCH --> UI
    ARCH --> SEC
    ARCH --> INT
```

### 1.2 Design Document Categories

Based on Application_Design_Principles.md, we create:

1. **System Architecture** - High-level system design
2. **API Specification** - Interface definitions
3. **Data Model Design** - Database and data structures
4. **Component Design** - Detailed component specifications
5. **UI/UX Design** - User interface specifications
6. **Security Architecture** - Security measures and protocols
7. **Integration Design** - External system interfaces
8. **Deployment Architecture** - Infrastructure and deployment

### 1.3 Why Comprehensive Design Matters

- **Clarity**: Everyone understands the system
- **Consistency**: Unified approach across teams
- **Traceability**: Design traces to requirements
- **Quality**: Issues caught before coding
- **Documentation**: Long-term maintenance reference

## 2. The Design Documentation Process

### 2.1 High-Level Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Gather Inputs] --> B[Analyze Requirements]
    B --> C[Apply Design Principles]
    C --> D[Create Architecture]
    D --> E[Detail Components]
    E --> F[Define Interfaces]
    F --> G[Specify Data Models]
    G --> H[Design Security]
    H --> I[Validate Design]
    I --> J[Review & Approve]
```

## 9. Common Patterns and Examples

### 9.1 E-commerce Design Pattern

Requirements → Design mapping for e-commerce:

```yaml
Requirements:
  - REQ-FUNC-001: Shopping cart management
  - REQ-FUNC-002: Product catalog
  - REQ-FUNC-003: Order processing
  - REQ-PERF-001: <2s page load
  - REQ-SCALE-001: 10K concurrent users

Resulting Design:
  Architecture:
    - Microservices: Cart, Catalog, Order services
    - API Gateway for routing
    - Redis for cart session storage
    - PostgreSQL for persistent data
    - Elasticsearch for product search
    
  API Design:
    - /api/v1/cart/* - Cart operations
    - /api/v1/products/* - Catalog browsing
    - /api/v1/orders/* - Order management
    
  Data Model:
    - Products table with full-text search
    - Cart with TTL in Redis
    - Orders with state machine
    
  Performance:
    - CDN for static assets
    - Database read replicas
    - Caching at multiple levels
```

### 9.2 SaaS Platform Pattern

```markdown
## Multi-tenant SaaS Design

### Derived from Requirements:
- REQ-FUNC-010: Multi-tenant isolation
- REQ-SEC-005: Data separation
- REQ-SCALE-002: 1000+ tenants

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Database Strategy**: Schema-per-tenant
   - Rationale: Strong isolation, easier compliance
   - Trade-off: More complex migrations

2. **API Design**: Tenant in subdomain
   - Example: `https://tenant1.api.example.com`
   - Rationale: Clear separation, easier routing

3. **Authentication**: Centralized SSO
   - Shared authentication service
   - Tenant-specific authorization

### Data Model:
```mermaid
erDiagram
    TENANT ||--o{ USER : has
    TENANT ||--o{ SUBSCRIPTION : has
    USER ||--o{ SESSION : has
    
    TENANT {
        uuid id
        string subdomain
        string name
        json settings
    }
```
```

### 9.3 Real-time Application Pattern

```markdown
## Real-time Features Design

### From Requirements:
- US-CHAT-001: Real-time messaging
- REQ-PERF-005: <100ms message delivery
- REQ-SCALE-003: 50K concurrent connections

### Design Solutions:

1. **WebSocket Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    CLIENT[Clients] -->|WS| LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> WS1[WS Server 1]
    LB --> WS2[WS Server 2]
    WS1 --> REDIS[Redis Pub/Sub]
    WS2 --> REDIS
    REDIS --> MQ[Message Queue]
```

2. **Message Flow Design**:
   - Client → WebSocket Server
   - Server → Redis Pub/Sub
   - Redis → All connected servers
   - Servers → Relevant clients

3. **Scaling Strategy**:
   - Sticky sessions for WebSocket
   - Redis for inter-server communication
   - Horizontal scaling of WS servers
```

## 10. Best Practices and Guidelines

### 10.1 Design Documentation Best Practices

#### Do's ✅

1. **Start with Requirements**
   - Every design decision traces to requirements
   - Use requirement IDs throughout documents
   - Justify all architectural choices

2. **Be Visual**
   - Use diagrams liberally
   - Show, don't just tell
   - Multiple views for complex systems

3. **Document Decisions**
   - Use Architecture Decision Records
   - Include alternatives considered
   - Explain trade-offs made

4. **Think Implementation**
   - Design should guide developers
   - Include enough detail to build
   - Provide clear examples

5. **Consider Operations**
   - Design for monitoring
   - Plan for debugging
   - Include deployment considerations

#### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't Over-Design**
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Don't design for imaginary requirements
   - YAGNI principle applies

2. **Don't Skip NFRs**
   - Performance matters from day one
   - Security can't be bolted on
   - Scalability needs upfront design

3. **Don't Work in Isolation**
   - Collaborate with developers
   - Review with stakeholders
   - Validate with architects

4. **Don't Forget Maintenance**
   - Design for changeability
   - Document for future developers
   - Consider upgrade paths

## Conclusion

Creating comprehensive design documentation from requirements and user stories is a systematic process that:

1. **Ensures Completeness**: All requirements translate to design
2. **Maintains Traceability**: Clear links throughout
3. **Enables Implementation**: Developers have clear guidance
4. **Supports Quality**: Issues caught before coding
5. **Facilitates Communication**: Everyone understands the system

By following this guide and using the provided prompts and tools, teams can transform their requirements into design documentation that serves as a solid foundation for successful implementation.

**Quick Reference**

```bash
# Generate all design documents
./generate-design-docs.sh

# Validate requirement coverage
python check_design_coverage.py

# Create review package
./prepare-design-review.sh

# Generate traceability matrix
python generate_traceability.py > traceability-matrix.md
```
