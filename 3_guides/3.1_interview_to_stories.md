### 1.2 Setting Up the Interview

#### Initial Context Setting
```markdown
## Prompt: Initialize AI Interview Session

I want you to act as an experienced business analyst and product manager. 
You'll be interviewing me about my software idea. Your goal is to:

1. Understand the problem deeply
2. Identify all stakeholders
3. Explore potential solutions
4. Define success metrics
5. Uncover hidden requirements

Use the following interview structure:
- Start with open-ended questions
- Dig deeper with follow-ups
- Challenge assumptions
- Explore edge cases
- Summarize periodically

Begin by asking me to describe my idea in 2-3 sentences.
```

### 1.3 The Five Levels of Why

For each feature or problem, dig deeper:

```markdown
## Example: Five Levels Deep

User: "I want a notification system"

Level 1: Why do you want notifications?
"To keep users informed"

Level 2: Why do users need to be kept informed?
"So they don't miss important updates"

Level 3: Why might they miss updates?
"Because they don't check the app frequently"

Level 4: Why don't they check frequently?
"The current process requires too many steps"

Level 5: Why are there too many steps?
"We haven't optimized the user flow"

Real Need: Streamlined user flow with smart notifications
```

### 1.4 Interview Question Framework

#### Problem Space Questions
```markdown
## Core Problem Questions

1. **Problem Identification**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who experiences this problem?
   - How painful is this problem? (1-10 scale)
   - What happens if we don't solve it?

2. **Current State Analysis**
   - How is this handled today?
   - What tools/processes are currently used?
   - What's broken about the current approach?
   - What works well that we should keep?

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - How many people/organizations are affected?
   - What's the frequency of this problem?
   - What's the cost (time/money/frustration)?
   - What other problems does this create?
```

#### Solution Space Questions
```markdown
## Solution Exploration Questions

1. **Vision Questions**
   - What does success look like?
   - Describe the ideal user experience
   - What's the "wow" moment for users?
   - What would make this indispensable?

2. **Feature Discovery**
   - What's the core feature that solves the main problem?
   - What supporting features are needed?
   - What features are "nice to have"?
   - What should we explicitly NOT build?

3. **User Journey**
   - Walk me through a typical user's day
   - When would they use this solution?
   - What triggers the need?
   - What happens after they use it?
```

## 2. Brainstorming Techniques

### 2.1 Structured Brainstorming

```markdown
## Prompt: Structured Feature Brainstorming

Based on our discussion about [problem], let's brainstorm solutions using 
these techniques:

1. **SCAMPER Method**:
   - Substitute: What can we replace?
   - Combine: What can we merge?
   - Adapt: What can we adjust?
   - Modify/Magnify: What can we emphasize?
   - Put to other uses: Alternative applications?
   - Eliminate: What can we remove?
   - Reverse/Rearrange: What can we flip?

2. **Mind Mapping**: Create a mind map with:
   - Core problem at center
   - Major branches for different aspects
   - Sub-branches for specific features
   - Connections between related ideas

3. **Crazy 8s**: Generate 8 wildly different approaches:
   - The premium solution (cost no object)
   - The bare minimum (MVP)
   - The mobile-first approach
   - The AI-powered version
   - The social/collaborative angle
   - The gamified solution
   - The completely automated version
   - The human-centered design

Provide 5 ideas for each category.
```

### 2.2 Feature Prioritization Matrix

```markdown
## Prompt: Create Feature Priority Matrix

Organize all brainstormed features into this matrix:

| Impact ↑ | Low Effort | High Effort |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **High** | 🎯 Quick Wins | 💎 Major Features |
| **Low** | 🔧 Nice to Have | ❌ Avoid |

For each feature, assess:
- User Impact (1-10)
- Development Effort (1-10)
- Business Value (1-10)
- Technical Risk (1-10)

Create a prioritized backlog with reasoning.
```

    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> F
    E --> G
```

## 4. Transforming Interviews to User Stories

### 4.1 The Transformation Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Interview Insights] --> B[Feature List]
    B --> C[User Scenarios]
    C --> D[Story Mapping]
    D --> E[Story Writing]
    E --> F[Story Refinement]
    F --> G[Final Stories]
```

### 4.2 Feature to Story Mapping

```markdown
## Prompt: Transform Features to Stories

For each feature identified in our interview, create user stories:

1. **Identify the Actor**: Who needs this feature?
2. **Define the Action**: What are they trying to do?
3. **Clarify the Benefit**: Why do they need it?
4. **Add Context**: When/where does this happen?
5. **Include Constraints**: What limitations exist?

Example Transformation:

**Interview Statement**: "Users complain they can't find old reports"

**Analysis**:
- Actor: Report consumers (managers, analysts)
- Problem: Discoverability and organization
- Need: Search and categorization

**Resulting Stories**:
1. "As a manager, I want to search reports by date range so that I can find quarterly summaries quickly"
2. "As an analyst, I want to tag reports with categories so that I can organize them by project"
3. "As a user, I want to see my recently viewed reports so that I can quickly return to my work"
```

### 4.3 Story Generation Template

```markdown
## Prompt: Generate Comprehensive User Stories

Based on the feature "[Feature Name]" from our interview, create:

1. **Epic Story** - High-level feature story
2. **User Stories** - 3-5 specific stories
3. **Technical Stories** - Backend requirements
4. **Edge Cases** - Error handling stories

For each story include:
- Story statement (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria (Given... When... Then...)
- Technical notes
- UI/UX considerations
- Dependencies

Use both XML and Markdown formats from AIDevFlow templates.
```

### 4.4 Story Writing Patterns

#### Pattern 1: CRUD Operations
```markdown
For any entity (e.g., "Project"), generate standard stories:

1. **Create**: As a [user], I want to create a new [entity]
2. **Read**: As a [user], I want to view [entity] details  
3. **Update**: As a [user], I want to edit [entity] information
4. **Delete**: As a [user], I want to remove obsolete [entity]
5. **List**: As a [user], I want to see all my [entities]
6. **Search**: As a [user], I want to find specific [entities]
```

#### Pattern 2: Workflow Stories
```markdown
For any process, map the workflow:

1. **Initiate**: As a [initiator], I want to start [process]
2. **Review**: As a [reviewer], I want to review [submissions]
3. **Approve/Reject**: As a [approver], I want to make decisions
4. **Notify**: As a [stakeholder], I want to be informed of [outcomes]
5. **Track**: As a [manager], I want to monitor [process] status
```

## 5. AI Prompts for Each Stage
