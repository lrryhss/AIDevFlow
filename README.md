# AI Dev Flow

**A systematic, AI-augmented framework for enterprise-grade software development.**

---

## Overview

The AI Dev Flow is a comprehensive, structured methodology designed to guide software projects from initial concept to final implementation. It provides a clear, repeatable process that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to enhance consistency, quality, and traceability throughout the development lifecycle.

This repository contains the core framework, including principles, templates, guides, and a complete case study, the **Cat Travel App**.

## The 5 Stages of AI Dev Flow

The framework is organized into five distinct stages:

1.  **Principles (`1_principles/`)**: The foundational concepts and best practices that underpin the entire development process.
2.  **Templates (`2_templates/`)**: Standardized, reusable formats for key artifacts like user stories, requirements, and unit tests.
3.  **Guides (`3_guides/`)**: Step-by-step instructions for executing each phase of the development lifecycle.
4.  **Examples (`4_examples/`)**: Concrete examples and case studies illustrating the application of the principles, templates, and guides.
5.  **Reference (`5_reference/`)**: A collection of AI prompts, role-specific guides, and other reference materials to accelerate development.

## Key Features

*   **Traceability**: Every requirement, design decision, and line of code is traceable back to its original user story.
*   **AI-Augmented**: The entire process is designed to be used in collaboration with AI assistants, with specific prompts and guides to maximize their effectiveness.
*   **Enterprise-Ready**: Includes comprehensive guides on coding standards, security best practices, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for enterprise-grade software.
*   **Comprehensive UI/UX Framework**: A full suite of UI/UX principles, templates, and SOPs to ensure a consistent and user-centered design process.
*   **Comprehensive Case Study**: The `cat_travel_app/` directory contains a complete, end-to-end example of the AI Dev Flow in action.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Dev Flow, it is recommended to follow these steps:

1.  **Read the Complete Guide**: Start with the [AIDevFlow_Complete_Guide.md](AIDevFlow_Complete_Guide.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the entire process.
2.  **Review the Principles**: Familiarize yourself with the core concepts in the `1_principles/` directory.
3.  **Explore the Cat Travel App**: Dive into the `cat_travel_app/` directory to see a real-world application of the AI Dev Flow.

## The Cat Travel App Case Study

The `cat_travel_app/` directory provides a complete, end-to-end implementation of the AI Dev Flow, from initial interview to final implementation guides. It includes:

*   **User Stories**: `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`
*   **Requirements**: `cat_travel_app/requirements/`
*   **Design Documents**: `cat_travel_app/design/`
*   **Unit Tests**: `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/`
*   **Implementation Guides**: `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/`

This case study serves as a practical guide and a valuable reference for applying the AI Dev Flow to your own projects.
