feat(design): Create detailed design documents for Cat Travel App

This commit introduces a comprehensive set of design documents for the Cat Travel App, covering the overall application architecture and detailed designs for the three core components:

- CatSafetyMonitoring
- CatTravelLogistics
- CatTravelPlanning

The new documentation follows the standards outlined in the design principles, including executive summaries, system architecture, data models, API specifications, UI/UX design, integration guides, development guides, security practices, and testing strategies.

This structured approach to design ensures clarity, consistency, and a solid foundation for the development phase.
