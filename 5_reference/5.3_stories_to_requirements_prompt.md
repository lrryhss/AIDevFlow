Generate detailed requirements from user stories.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

Once provided, I will study all the user stories located there. I will then ask you for the `[Project/Module Name]`. Based on the user story folder path, I will propose a default output path for the requirements (e.g., by replacing `user_stories` with `requirements` in the path), which you can confirm or modify.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [Requirements Principles](../../1_principles/1.2_requirements_principles.md)
- [Requirement XML Template](../../2_templates/2.3_requirement.xml)
- [Requirements Writing Style Guide](../../docs/requirements_writing_style_guide.md)
- [Phase 1: Requirements Discovery and Analysis SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_1_requirements_discovery_analysis_sop.md) (especially sections on Business Requirements Gathering and Technical Requirements Analysis)
- [Review and Approval Process SOP](../../docs/SOPs/review_approval_process_sop.md) (for understanding approval criteria)
- [AI Prompts for Business Analysts](../roles/business_analyst_prompts.md) (for typical BA considerations)
- [AI Prompts for Software Architects](../roles/software_architect_prompts.md) (for technical feasibility and non-functional aspects)
- [AI Prompts for Quality Assurance Leads](../roles/quality_assurance_lead_prompts.md) (for testability of requirements)

Then, create a complete set of detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the `[Project/Module Name]`. Ensure all edge cases and error conditions implied by the stories are covered. Output the requirements in the `2.3_requirement.xml` format."
