# AI Prompts Quick Reference

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for AI prompts to generate implementation guides, unit tests, and development artifacts.

## Implementation Guide Generation Prompts

### 1. Complete System Implementation
```
"Read and study all application documentation, requirements, and unit tests in [project directory]. Create a comprehensive set of implementation guides that:
- Break down the entire system into logical phases
- Phase 1: Foundation (database, core infrastructure)
- Phase 2: Core Features (essential business logic)
- Phase 3: Extended Features (additional functionality)
- Phase 4: Integration (external systems)
- Phase 5: Optimization (performance, security)

Each guide should follow Implementation_Guide_Template.xml format and include:
- Clear dependencies between components
- Realistic time estimates
- Links to requirements and design docs
- Test requirements for verification
- Security considerations"
```

### 2. Feature-Specific Implementation
```
"Analyze the [Feature Name] feature including:
- Requirements: [list requirements]
- Design docs: [design doc paths]
- API specs: [API spec paths]
- Existing codebase: [relevant code paths]
- Test specifications: [test file paths]

Generate implementation guides that break down this feature into:
1. Data model implementation
2. Business logic services
3. API endpoints
4. Frontend components (if applicable)
5. Integration points
6. Security measures
7. Performance optimizations
8. Comprehensive tests

Use Implementation_Guide_Template.xml format with step-by-step tasks."
```

### 3. API Implementation from Spec
```
"Given the OpenAPI/Swagger specification at [spec file path], generate implementation guides for:
- All defined endpoints with proper routing
- Request/response models with validation
- Error handling for each endpoint
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Logging and monitoring
- Comprehensive tests for each endpoint

Organize guides by resource and priority."
```

### 4. Database Implementation
```
"Based on the database design document at [design doc path] and ERD diagram, create implementation guides for:
- Initial database setup and configuration
- Schema creation with all tables and relationships
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Migration scripts for version control
- Seed data for development and testing
- Repository/DAO layer implementation
- Connection pooling configuration
- Backup and recovery procedures

Include SQL scripts and code examples."
```

### 5. Refactoring Implementation
```
"Analyze the legacy code in [legacy code path] and the target architecture in [new architecture doc]. Generate implementation guides for refactoring that:
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Break down into safe, incremental steps
- Include feature flags for gradual rollout
- Provide rollback procedures
- Update tests for new structure
- Track performance metrics
- Plan deprecation timeline"
```

## Unit Test Generation Prompts

### 6. Full Test Coverage
```
"Study all application requirements, documentation, and source code in [project directory]. Create a comprehensive unit test suite using Unit_Test_Template.xml format that:
- Achieves minimum 90% code coverage
- Tests all public methods and functions
- Includes positive, negative, and edge cases
- Validates all business rules
- Tests error handling and exceptions
- Includes performance tests where applicable
- Uses appropriate mocks for dependencies"
```

### 7. Component-Specific Tests
```
"For the [Component Name] at [component path] with dependencies [list dependencies], generate unit tests that:
- Test each method in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Cover valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases
- Test error scenarios and exceptions
- Validate business logic rules
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test concurrent operations if applicable

Format using Unit_Test_Template.xml with complete test data and assertions."
```

### 8. Requirements-Based Tests
```
"Given these requirements:
[List each requirement with ID]

Generate unit tests that:
- Validate each requirement individually
- Include both passing and failing scenarios
- Test boundary conditions
- Verify error messages and codes
- Check security implications
- Include integration points that need mocking

Use Unit_Test_Template.xml format with clear traceability to requirements."
```

### 9. Test Data Generation
```
"For testing [System/Component Name], generate comprehensive test data sets including:
1. Valid data covering all scenarios
2. Invalid data for negative testing
3. Edge cases and boundary values
4. Performance test data (large datasets)
5. Security test data (injection attempts)
6. Internationalization test data

Format as structured JSON/XML with clear categorization and descriptions."
```

## Combined Prompts

### 10. Complete Feature Development
```
"For the [Feature Name] feature:
1. First, analyze all provided documentation
2. Generate implementation guides breaking down the feature
3. Create comprehensive unit tests for each component
4. Include integration test scenarios
5. Provide test data sets
6. Document security considerations
7. Include performance requirements

Output both Implementation Guide XMLs and Unit Test XMLs with full coverage."
```

### 11. API Endpoint with Tests
```
"For the API endpoint [Method] [Path]:
1. Generate implementation guide including:
   - Route definition and controller
   - Service layer implementation
   - Data access layer
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   
2. Generate unit tests covering:
   - All success scenarios
   - Validation failures
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Error conditions
   - Performance requirements

Use both Implementation_Guide_Template.xml and Unit_Test_Template.xml."
```

### 12. Microservice Implementation
```
"Design and implement the [Service Name] microservice:
1. Generate implementation guides for:
   - Service setup and configuration
   - API endpoints
   - Database schema
   - Message queue integration
   - Health checks
   - Docker configuration
   
2. Generate comprehensive tests for:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests
   - Contract tests
   - Performance tests

Include inter-service communication patterns and error handling."
```

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths and requirements
2. **Set Context**: Explain the technology stack and constraints
3. **Define Output**: Specify the exact format needed (XML templates)
4. **Include Examples**: Reference existing code or patterns to follow
5. **Set Quality Bar**: Specify coverage requirements, performance needs
6. **Request Rationale**: Ask for explanations of design decisions
7. **Iterate**: Start with high-level, then drill down into specifics
