Generate detailed design documentation from approved requirements.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

Once provided, I will study all the requirements (and user stories, if provided) located there. I will then ask you for the `[Project/Module Name]` for which you need the design. After that, I will analyze the requirements and propose a logical structure for the design documentation (e.g., by service, module, or architectural layer). I will ask you to confirm or modify this proposed structure.

Based on the requirements folder path, I will propose a default output path for the design documents (e.g., by replacing `requirements` with `design` in the path), which you can confirm or modify.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md)
- [Phase 2: Architecture and Design SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_2_architecture_design_sop.md)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for architectural patterns and code structure considerations)
- [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md) (for secure design patterns)
- [AI Prompts for Software Architects](../roles/software_architect_prompts.md) (for architectural considerations and design patterns)
- [AI Prompts for Technical Leads](../roles/technical_lead_prompts.md) (for detailed design and implementation planning considerations)
- [AI Prompts for Data Architects](../roles/data_architect_prompts.md) (for data modeling and database design considerations)

Then, using the confirmed organization structure, create a complete set of detailed design documents for the `[Project/Module Name]`. Ensure the design addresses all functional and non-functional requirements. The design documentation should cover:
- High-level system architecture and component breakdown.
- Detailed design for each major component/service (e.g., responsibilities, interfaces).
- API specifications (if applicable).
- Database schemas and data models.
- Key architectural decisions and their rationale.
- UI/UX flows (if applicable).

Output the design documents in Markdown or XML format (as appropriate for each section) to the confirmed output path."
