Generate detailed design documentation from approved requirements.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

Once provided, I will study all the requirements (and user stories, if provided) located there. I will then ask you for the `[Project/Module Name]` for which you need the design. After that, I will analyze the requirements and propose a logical structure for the design documentation (e.g., by service, module, or architectural layer). I will ask you to confirm or modify this proposed structure.

**Crucially, I will then read and strictly apply Section 2: "Documentation Structure Standards" from `1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md`. Based on these standards, I will propose the exact directory and file organization (including naming and numbering conventions) that I will use for the design documentation. I will ask you to confirm or modify this proposed file structure.**

Based on the requirements folder path, I will propose a default output path for the design documents (e.g., by replacing `requirements` with `design` in the path), which you can confirm or modify.

**Before generating any design content, I will explicitly read and internalize the following to ensure strict adherence to our standards:**
- All sections from 3 to 7 of [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md).
- The entire [Complete Mermaid Diagram Syntax Guide](../../docs/mermaid_syntax_guide.md).
- **All documents listed under "Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices" below.**

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md) (Crucial: Strictly adhere to *all sections* of this document, especially regarding documentation structure, formatting, and content organization principles.)
- [Phase 2: Architecture and Design SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_2_architecture_design_sop.md)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for architectural patterns and code structure considerations)
- [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md) (for secure design patterns)
- [AI Prompts for Software Architects](../roles/software_architect_prompts.md) (for architectural considerations and design patterns)
- [AI Prompts for Technical Leads](../roles/technical_lead_prompts.md) (for detailed design and implementation planning considerations)
- [AI Prompts for Data Architects](../roles/data_architect_prompts.md) (for data modeling and database design considerations)

Before proceeding with design generation, explicitly confirm that you have read and understood all sections of the [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md) and the [Complete Mermaid Diagram Syntax Guide](../../docs/mermaid_syntax_guide.md), and all other referenced documentation.

Then, using the confirmed organization structure and file structure, create a complete set of detailed design documents for the `[Project/Module Name]`. Ensure the design addresses all functional and non-functional requirements. The design documentation should cover:
- High-level system architecture and component breakdown (using Mermaid diagrams as per [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#4-mermaid-diagram-guidelines)).
- Detailed design for each major component/service (e.g., responsibilities, interfaces).
- API specifications (if applicable, following the structure in [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#64-api-specification-template)).
- Database schemas and data models (using Mermaid ERDs as per [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#42-entity-relationship-diagrams) and following the structure in [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#63-data-model-template)).
- Key architectural decisions and their rationale.
- UI/UX flows (if applicable, using Mermaid sequence or state diagrams as per [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#43-sequence-diagrams) and [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#44-state-diagrams)).

Output the design documents in Markdown or XML format (as appropriate for each section) to the confirmed output path. Ensure each document adheres to the header and section hierarchy specified in [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#31-document-header) and [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md#32-section-hierarchy)."
