# AI Prompts for Risk Owners

This document provides AI prompts tailored for Risk Owners to assist with monitoring, managing, and mitigating specific risks assigned to them, adhering to the project's SOPs and best practices.

## 1. Risk Monitoring

### 1.1 Understanding Assigned Risks

**Prompt**: "I have been assigned as the owner for `[Risk ID/Description]` in the project's risk register. Summarize this risk, including its potential impact, likelihood, and current mitigation strategy, referencing the [Risk Management SOP](../../docs/SOPs/risk_management_sop.md)."

### 1.2 Monitoring Risk Triggers

**Prompt**: "What are the key indicators or triggers I should be monitoring for `[Risk ID/Description]` that would suggest the risk is about to materialize or its likelihood/impact has changed? How frequently should I monitor these triggers?"

## 2. Risk Management & Mitigation

### 2.1 Developing Mitigation Plans

**Prompt**: "For `[Risk ID/Description]`, the current mitigation strategy is `[Current Strategy]`. Propose a more detailed action plan for this mitigation, including specific steps, responsible parties, and timelines. Consider alternative mitigation approaches if the current one is insufficient, referencing the [Risk Management SOP](../../docs/SOPs/risk_management_sop.md)."

### 2.2 Executing Contingency Plans

**Prompt**: "`[Risk ID/Description]` has materialized. The contingency plan is `[Contingency Plan Description]`. Outline the immediate steps I need to take to execute this plan, and what information I need to communicate to the project manager and relevant stakeholders."

## 3. Reporting & Communication

### 3.1 Providing Risk Updates

**Prompt**: "Prepare a concise update on the status of `[Risk ID/Description]` for the weekly risk review meeting. Include any changes in likelihood or impact, progress on mitigation activities, and any new concerns or observations."

### 3.2 Escalating Risks

**Prompt**: "I believe `[Risk ID/Description]` is escalating beyond my ability to manage, or its impact has increased significantly. What information do I need to prepare to escalate this risk to the Project Manager and Project Sponsor, as per the [Risk Management SOP](../../docs/SOPs/risk_management_sop.md)?"
