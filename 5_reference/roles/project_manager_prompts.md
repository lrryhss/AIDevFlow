Include key phases, major milestones, estimated timelines, and resource allocation, referencing the [Phase 1: Requirements Discovery and Analysis SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_1_requirements_discovery_analysis_sop.md) and [Phase 2: Architecture and Design SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_2_architecture_design_sop.md)."

### 1.2 Identifying Stakeholders

**Prompt**: "For `[Project Name]`, identify all potential stakeholders (internal and external) and categorize them by their influence and interest. Suggest a strategy for engaging each group, as per the [Phase 1: Requirements Discovery and Analysis SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_1_requirements_discovery_analysis_sop.md)."

### 1.3 Risk Assessment and Planning

**Prompt**: "Based on the current project status and scope for `[Project Name]`, what are the top 5 risks we should be monitoring? For each risk, suggest a likelihood, impact, and initial mitigation strategy, referencing the [Risk Management SOP](../../docs/SOPs/risk_management_sop.md)."

## 2. Project Execution & Monitoring
