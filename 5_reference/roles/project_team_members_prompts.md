# AI Prompts for Project Team Members

This document provides AI prompts tailored for general project team members (e.g., individual contributors, developers, QA engineers) to assist with daily tasks, collaboration, and adherence to project standards, adhering to the project's SOPs and best practices.

## 1. Daily Development Tasks

### 1.1 Understanding a New Task

**Prompt**: "I've been assigned `[Task ID/Description]`. Based on the associated user story (`[path/to/user_story.md]`) and requirements (`[path/to/requirements.xml]`), what are the key objectives and acceptance criteria I need to focus on?"

### 1.2 Seeking Implementation Guidance

**Prompt**: "I'm working on `[Task ID/Description]` and need to implement `[specific component/function]`. Are there any existing [Implementation Guides](../../2_templates/2.4_implementation_guide.xml) or code examples that can help me, especially regarding `[specific technology/pattern]`?"

### 1.3 Git Operations

**Prompt**: "I need to `[perform Git operation, e.g., create a new branch, pull latest changes, revert a commit]`. What are the correct Git commands and best practices for this, referencing our [Git Workflow and Best Practices SOP](../git_sop.md)?"

## 2. Collaboration & Communication

### 2.1 Reporting Progress

**Prompt**: "Prepare a concise progress update for our daily stand-up meeting for `[Task ID/Description]`. Include what I completed yesterday, what I plan to do today, and any blockers I'm facing."

### 2.2 Asking for Code Review

**Prompt**: "I've completed `[Feature/Bugfix Name]` on branch `[branch-name]` and it's ready for code review. What information should I include in my Pull Request description to facilitate an effective review, referencing our code review guidelines?"

### 2.3 Documenting Decisions

**Prompt**: "During a discussion about `[Topic]`, we decided to `[Decision]`. How should I document this decision and its rationale, and where should it be stored?"

## 3. Quality & Standards Adherence

### 3.1 Ensuring Code Quality

**Prompt**: "Before committing my code for `[Task ID/Description]`, what are the key aspects of code quality (e.g., readability, maintainability, performance) I should check, referencing our [Coding Style Guides](../../docs/style_guides/coding/)?"

### 3.2 Writing Effective Unit Tests

**Prompt**: "I need to write unit tests for `[Component/Function Name]`. Based on the [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md) and [Unit Test XML Template](../../2_templates/2.5_unit_test.xml), what are the essential test cases (positive, negative, edge) I should include?"

## 4. Troubleshooting & Problem Solving

### 4.1 Debugging Assistance

**Prompt**: "I'm getting an unexpected output from `[function/module name]` when `[describe scenario]`. The input is `[input data]` and the output is `[actual output]`. The expected output was `[expected output]`. What steps can I take to debug this issue?"

### 4.2 Understanding Error Messages

**Prompt**: "I received the following error message: `[Error Message]`. What does this error typically mean, and what are the first steps I should take to investigate it?"
