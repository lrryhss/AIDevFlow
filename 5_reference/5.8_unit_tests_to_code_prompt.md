Generate application code that satisfies provided unit test specifications.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the unit test XML files (e.g., `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute paths to the folders containing:
- Design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/`)
- Requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`)
- Original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`)
- Implementation guides (e.g., `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/`)

Once provided, I will study all the unit test XML files (and all other provided contextual documents). I will then ask you for the programming language (`[language]`, e.g., `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Java`) for the code generation.

**Before generating any code, I will explicitly read and internalize the following to ensure strict adherence to our standards:**
- All sections of [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md) (to understand the test cases and expected behaviors).
- All sections of [Implementation Principles](../../1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md) (for code structure, best practices, and overall implementation strategy).
- All documents listed under "Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices" below.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Requirements Principles](../../1_principles/1.2_requirements_principles.md) (if requirements are provided)
- [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md) (for overall architectural context and component responsibilities)
- [Implementation Guide Usage](../../3_guides/3.4_implementation_guide_usage.md) (for understanding how implementation tasks are structured)
- [Phase 3: Implementation and Testing SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_3_implementation_testing_sop.md) (for implementation and testing phase context)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for general coding standards)
- Language-specific coding style guides (e.g., `docs/style_guides/coding/python_style_guide.md`)
- [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md) (for secure coding patterns)
- Language-specific security best practices guides (e.g., `docs/style_guides/security/python_security_best_practices.md`)
- [AI Prompts for Software Developers](../roles/software_developers_prompts.md) (for developer-centric tasks and code generation)
- [AI Prompts for Technical Leads](../roles/technical_lead_prompts.md) (for code review and quality aspects)
- [AI Prompts for DevOps Engineers](../roles/devops_engineer_prompts.md) (for deployment and environment considerations)

Then, using the provided unit test XML files and the confirmed language:
1.  **Generate the application code** that satisfies the requirements implied by the unit tests. Focus on writing just enough code to make the tests pass.
2.  **Provide instructions to save the code** to the appropriate file paths, inferring logical locations based on the project structure and component names (e.g., `cat_travel_app/src/services/tag_management_service.py`).
3.  **Provide commands to run the relevant unit tests** (from the provided XML files) to verify the generated code.

Output the generated code in a code block, followed by the save instructions and test commands."
