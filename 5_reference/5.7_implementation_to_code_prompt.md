Generate code based on a detailed implementation guide.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the `implementation_guide.xml` file you want to implement (e.g., `cat_travel_app/implementation/guides/CatTravelApp/P1_001_Overall_Project_Setup.xml`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute paths to the folders containing:
- Design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/`)
- Unit test XML files (e.g., `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/`)
- Requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`)
- Original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`)

Once provided, I will study the `implementation_guide.xml` (and all other provided contextual documents). I will then **extract the programming language from the `<TechnicalStack><Language>` field within the `implementation_guide.xml`**. This language will be used for code generation and for referencing language-specific style/security guides.

**Before generating any code, I will explicitly read and internalize the following to ensure strict adherence to our standards:**
- All sections of [Implementation Principles](../../1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md).
- The entire [Complete Mermaid Diagram Syntax Guide](../../docs/mermaid_syntax_guide.md) (for any diagrams within implementation guides).
- All documents listed under "Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices" below.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Requirements Principles](../../1_principles/1.2_requirements_principles.md) (if requirements are provided)
- [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md) (for overall architectural context)
- [Implementation Principles](../../1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md) (Crucial: Strictly adhere to *all sections* of this document, especially regarding guide structure, development methodologies, and code organization.)
- [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md) (for understanding test validation requirements)
- [Implementation Guide Usage](../../3_guides/3.4_implementation_guide_usage.md) (for workflow and structure)
- [Phase 3: Implementation and Testing SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_3_implementation_testing_sop.md) (for implementation and testing phase context)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for coding standards and examples)
- Language-specific coding style guides (e.g., `docs/style_guides/coding/python_style_guide.md`)
- [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md) (for secure coding patterns)
- Language-specific security best practices guides (e.g., `docs/style_guides/security/python_security_best_practices.md`)
- [AI Prompts for Software Developers](../roles/software_developers_prompts.md) (for developer-centric tasks and code generation)
- [AI Prompts for Technical Leads](../roles/technical_lead_prompts.md) (for code review and quality aspects)
- [AI Prompts for DevOps Engineers](../roles/devops_engineer_prompts.md) (for deployment and environment considerations)

Then, using the provided `implementation_guide.xml` and the extracted language:
1.  **Generate the code** for the tasks specified in the implementation guide. Ensure the code adheres to all referenced coding standards, security best practices, and is testable.
2.  **Provide instructions to save the code** to the appropriate file paths as indicated in the implementation guide.
3.  **Provide commands to run the relevant unit tests** (referenced in the implementation guide) to verify the generated code.

Output the generated code in a code block, followed by the save instructions and test commands."
