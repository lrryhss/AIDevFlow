Generate a phased implementation plan and detailed implementation guides from design documentation and unit tests.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Please also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the unit test XML files (e.g., `cat_travel_app/tests/unit/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`) and the original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

Once provided, I will study all the design documents, unit tests (and requirements/user stories, if provided) located there. I will then ask you for the `[Project/Module Name]` for which you need the implementation. I will analyze the provided documents for a relevant feature name or ticket number (e.g., from a `Reference` tag in the unit tests or a `Requirement` ID) and **propose a Git branch name** based on the project's naming convention (e.g., `feature/REQ-CAT-004-tracking-tag-integration`). I will then ask you to confirm or modify this proposed name.

Based on this information, I will first **propose a phased implementation plan** (e.g., 3-4 sprints) for the `[Project/Module Name]`. For each phase/sprint, I will break down the work into actionable tasks, identify key deliverables, and suggest a logical order of development. I will prioritize core functionality first. I will ask you to confirm or modify this proposed plan.

Based on the design documentation folder path, I will propose a structured output path that includes phase-based subdirectories, as described in **Section 2.4 of `1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md`**.

**Before generating any implementation content, I will explicitly read and internalize the following to ensure strict adherence to our standards:**
- All sections of [Implementation Principles](../../1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md), paying special attention to **Section 2.4** for directory structure and **Section 2.4.2** for file naming.
- All documents listed under "Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices" below.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Requirements Principles](../../1_principles/1.2_requirements_principles.md) (if requirements are provided)
- [Design Principles](../../1_principles/1.3_design_principles.md) (for overall architectural context)
- [Implementation Principles](../../1_principles/1.4_implementation_principles.md) (Crucial: Strictly adhere to *all sections* of this document, especially regarding guide structure, development methodologies, and code organization.)
- [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md) (for understanding test validation requirements)
- [Implementation Guide Usage](../../3_guides/3.4_implementation_guide_usage.md) (for workflow and structure)
- [Phase 3: Implementation and Testing SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_3_implementation_testing_sop.md) (for implementation and testing phase context)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for coding standards and examples)
- [Enterprise Security Best Practices](../../docs/enterprise_security_best_practices.md) (for secure coding patterns)
- [AI Prompts for Software Developers](../roles/software_developers_prompts.md) (for developer-centric tasks and code generation)
- [AI Prompts for Technical Leads](../roles/technical_lead_prompts.md) (for implementation oversight and technical guidance)
- [AI Prompts for DevOps Engineers](../roles/devops_engineer_prompts.md) (for deployment and environment considerations)

Once I have a confirmed phased implementation plan and output path, I will **generate all detailed implementation guides for every task in every phase of the plan without stopping**.

For *each actionable task* identified in the phased plan, I will create a separate `2.4_implementation_guide.xml` file. I will name each file according to the **Phase and Task Numbering System (Section 2.4.2)** (e.g., `P1_001_Database_Setup.xml`).

For each guide, I will:
1.  **Propose a Git branch name** that is directly derived from the implementation guide's filename (e.g., `feature/P1_001_Database_Setup`).
2.  **Strictly adhere to the `2_templates/2.4_implementation_guide.xml` template by generating detailed content for ALL sections**. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `<Purpose>`
    *   `<ScopeAndObjectives>`
    *   `<TechnicalStack>`
    *   `<Prerequisites>`
    *   `<TestReferences>`
    *   `<ImplementationSteps>`
    *   `<QualityAssurance>`
    *   `<IntegrationPoints>`
    *   `<ValidationAndVerification>` (including `<Checklist>`, `<TestValidation>`, and `<AcceptanceCriteria>`)
    *   Other relevant fields based on the design and requirements context.
3.  Ensure the proposed **Git branch name is included in the `<Metadata><GitBranchName>` field.**

Output all generated files to their respective confirmed paths."
