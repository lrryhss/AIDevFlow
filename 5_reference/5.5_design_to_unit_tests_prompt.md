Generate detailed unit tests from design documentation.

**Your Prompt:**

"Please provide the absolute path to the folder containing the design documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/design/CatSafetyMonitoring/`).

Optionally, you can also provide the absolute path to the folder containing the requirements documents (e.g., `cat_travel_app/requirements/`) and the original user stories (e.g., `cat_travel_app/user_stories/`).

Once provided, I will study all the design documents (and requirements/user stories, if provided) located there. I will then ask you for the `[Component/Module Name]` for which you need the unit tests. After that, I will analyze the design and propose a logical organization structure for the unit tests (e.g., by component, by feature, by test type). I will ask you to confirm or modify this proposed structure.

Based on the design documentation folder path, I will propose a default output path for the unit test XML files (e.g., by replacing `design` with `tests/unit` in the path), which you can confirm or modify.

**Before generating any test content, I will explicitly read and internalize the following to ensure strict adherence to our standards:**
- All sections of [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md).
- The entire [Complete Mermaid Diagram Syntax Guide](../../docs/mermaid_syntax_guide.md) (for any diagrams within test documentation).
- All documents listed under "Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices" below.

Leverage the following documentation for context and best practices:
- [User Story Principles](../../1_principles/1.1_user_story_principles.md) (if user stories are provided)
- [Requirements Principles](../../1_principles/1.2_requirements_principles.md) (if requirements are provided)
- [Unit Test Principles](../../1_principles/1.5_unit_test_principles.md) (Crucial: Strictly adhere to *all sections* of this document, especially regarding test case design, data management, and assertions.)
- [Unit Test XML Template](../../2_templates/2.5_unit_test.xml)
- [Phase 3: Implementation and Testing SOP](../../docs/SOPs/phase_3_implementation_testing_sop.md) (for testing strategy and quality gates)
- [Enterprise Coding Style Guide](../../docs/enterprise_coding_style_guide.md) (for test code examples and conventions)
- [AI Prompts for Quality Assurance Leads](../roles/quality_assurance_lead_prompts.md) (for test case generation and coverage)
- [AI Prompts for Software Developers](../roles/software_developers_prompts.md) (for test implementation considerations)

Then, using the confirmed organization structure and file structure, create a complete set of detailed unit tests for the `[Component/Module Name]`. Ensure the tests cover all functional and non-functional requirements addressed by the design, including positive, negative, and edge cases, and validate error handling.

**For each individual test case, generate a separate `2.5_unit_test.xml` file.** Name each file descriptively (e.g., `[component_name]_[test_scenario].xml`). Output these files to the confirmed output path."
