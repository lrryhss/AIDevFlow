## 1. Introduction

Well-written requirements are the foundation of successful software projects. This guide provides principles and patterns for creating clear, testable, and traceable requirements that bridge the gap between user needs and technical implementation.

### Core Principles

1. **User-Centric**: Focus on user value and outcomes
2. **Testable**: Every requirement must be verifiable
3. **Clear**: Unambiguous and understandable
4. **Complete**: Cover all aspects of the feature
5. **Traceable**: Link to source and implementation

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 The User Story Format

User stories capture requirements from the user's perspective, focusing on the value delivered.

#### Classic Format
```
As a [type of user]
I want [to perform some action]
So that [I achieve some benefit/value]
```

#### Extended Format with Context
```
As a [type of user]
I want [to perform some action]
So that [I achieve some benefit/value]
When [context/condition]
Given [preconditions]
```

### 2.2 User Story Examples

#### Basic User Story
```
As a customer
I want to filter products by price range
So that I can find items within my budget
```

#### Context-Rich User Story
```
As a mobile app user
I want to save articles for offline reading
So that I can read content during my commute
When I don't have internet connectivity
Given I have previously downloaded the articles
```

### 2.3 INVEST Criteria

Good user stories follow the INVEST principle:

- **I**ndependent: Can be developed and delivered separately
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed and refined
- **V**aluable: Delivers value to the user
- **E**stimable: Can be sized/estimated
- **S**mall: Fits in a single iteration
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

### 2.4 User Story Hierarchy

```
Epic
├── Feature
│   ├── User Story
│   │   ├── Task
│   │   └── Task
│   └── User Story
└── Feature
```

#### Epic Example
```
Epic: E-Commerce Checkout System
├── Feature: Shopping Cart Management
│   ├── Story: Add items to cart
│   ├── Story: Update quantities
│   └── Story: Remove items
├── Feature: Payment Processing
│   ├── Story: Credit card payment
│   ├── Story: PayPal integration
│   └── Story: Apply discount codes
└── Feature: Order Confirmation
    ├── Story: Display order summary
    └── Story: Send email confirmation
```

### 2.5 Writing Effective User Stories

#### DO:
- ✅ Focus on user goals, not implementation
- ✅ Keep stories small and focused
- ✅ Include acceptance criteria
- ✅ Use active voice
- ✅ Be specific about the user role

#### DON'T:
- ❌ Include technical implementation details
- ❌ Combine multiple features in one story
- ❌ Use vague terms like "user-friendly"
- ❌ Write from the system's perspective

## 3. Use Case Diagrams with Mermaid

Use case diagrams visualize the interactions between users (actors) and the system, showing what the system does from the user's perspective.

### 3.1 Basic Use Case Diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    %% Actors
    Customer((Customer))
    Admin((Admin))
    PaymentSystem((Payment<br/>System))
    
    %% System boundary

### 3.4 Use Case Documentation Template

For each use case in the diagram, create detailed documentation:

```markdown
## Use Case: [Name]

**ID:** UC-001  
**Actor:** [Primary Actor]  
**Description:** [Brief description]  

### Preconditions
- [What must be true before this use case can start]

### Main Flow
1. Actor performs [action]
2. System responds with [response]
3. Actor provides [input]
4. System validates and [action]
5. Use case ends successfully

### Alternative Flows
**3a.** Invalid input provided:
   1. System displays error message
   2. Return to step 3

### Postconditions
- [What is true after successful completion]

### Business Rules
- [Any business constraints or rules]
```

## 4. Requirements Types and Formats

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do.

#### Format Template
```markdown
**ID:** FR-XXX
**Title:** [Descriptive title]
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Category:** [Feature area]

**Description:**
[Detailed description of the functionality]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Dependencies:** [List any dependent requirements]
**Notes:** [Additional context or constraints]
```

#### Example
```markdown
**ID:** FR-101
**Title:** Password Reset Functionality
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Authentication

**Description:**
Users must be able to reset their password through a secure email-based process when they forget their current password.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can request password reset from login page
- [ ] System sends reset link to registered email within 2 minutes
- [ ] Reset link expires after 24 hours
- [ ] User must enter new password twice for confirmation
- [ ] Password must meet security requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, number, special char)
- [ ] User receives confirmation email after successful reset
- [ ] Old password no longer works after reset

**Dependencies:** FR-001 (User Registration), FR-100 (Email Service)
**Notes:** Reset tokens must be cryptographically secure and single-use
```

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform.

#### Categories and Examples

**Performance Requirements**
```markdown
**ID:** NFR-001
**Category:** Performance
**Metric:** Page Load Time

**Requirement:**
95% of all page loads must complete within 2 seconds under normal load conditions (up to 1000 concurrent users).

**Measurement Method:**
- Synthetic monitoring from 3 geographic locations
- Real user monitoring (RUM) data
- Load testing with JMeter

**Target:** < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
**Threshold:** < 3 seconds (99th percentile)
```

**Security Requirements**
```markdown
**ID:** NFR-010
**Category:** Security
**Aspect:** Data Encryption

**Requirement:**
All sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption methods.

**Implementation:**
- Transit: TLS 1.3 minimum
- Rest: AES-256 encryption
- Key management: HSM-based key storage
- Compliance: PCI-DSS Level 1
```

**Usability Requirements**
```markdown
**ID:** NFR-020
**Category:** Usability
**Metric:** Task Completion Rate

**Requirement:**
New users must be able to complete core tasks without training or documentation.

**Success Criteria:**
- 80% task completion rate for first-time users
- Average task time < 3 minutes
- System Usability Scale (SUS) score > 70
```

### 4.3 Business Rules

Business rules capture domain-specific logic and constraints.

```markdown
**ID:** BR-001
**Title:** Order Cancellation Policy
**Category:** Order Management

**Rule:**
Orders can only be cancelled if:
1. Order status is "Pending" or "Processing"
2. No items have been shipped
3. Less than 24 hours have passed since order placement

**Exception:**
Premium members can cancel up to 48 hours after placement

**Implementation:**
```
IF (order.status IN ['Pending', 'Processing']) 
   AND (order.shipped_items = 0)
   AND (NOW() - order.created_at < 24 hours 
        OR (customer.tier = 'Premium' AND NOW() - order.created_at < 48 hours))
THEN allow_cancellation = TRUE
ELSE allow_cancellation = FALSE
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria Patterns

### 5.1 Given-When-Then (Gherkin)

Best for behavior-driven development (BDD):

```gherkin
Given [initial context/state]
When [action/event occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcomes]
```

#### Example
```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  And I have a registered account with email "user@example.com"
  When I enter "user@example.com" in the email field
  And I enter "ValidPass123!" in the password field
  And I click the "Login" button
  Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
  And I should see "Welcome back!" message
  And my session should be active for 24 hours
```

### 5.2 Checklist Format

Best for features with multiple requirements:

```markdown
**Feature:** User Profile Management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can upload profile picture (JPEG, PNG only, max 5MB)
- [ ] User can edit first name, last name, and bio
- [ ] Bio is limited to 500 characters with character counter
- [ ] Changes are saved automatically after 2 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] User sees confirmation message after successful save
- [ ] Validation errors appear inline without page refresh
- [ ] Profile picture is resized to 200x200 for display
- [ ] Original image is preserved for future use
```

### 5.3 Rule-Based Format

Best for complex business logic:

```markdown
**Feature:** Discount Calculation

**Rules:**
1. IF cart total > $100 THEN apply 10% discount
2. IF user is VIP member THEN apply additional 5% discount
3. IF coupon code is valid THEN apply coupon discount
4. Discounts are cumulative but cannot exceed 30% total
5. Shipping is free for orders > $50 after discounts

**Examples:**
- Regular user, $120 cart: $120 - 10% = $108
- VIP user, $120 cart: $120 - 10% - 5% = $102
- VIP user, $120 cart, 20% coupon: $120 - 10% - 5% - 20% = $84 (30% max = $84)
```

### 5.4 Specification by Example

Best for data-driven requirements:

```markdown
**Feature:** Age Verification

**Examples Table:**
| Birth Date | Today's Date | Expected Age | Can Purchase Alcohol |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 2000-01-01 | 2023-01-01  | 23           | Yes                 |
| 2002-01-01 | 2023-01-01  | 21           | Yes                 |
| 2002-01-02 | 2023-01-01  | 20           | No                  |
| 2005-12-31 | 2023-01-01  | 17           | No                  |

**Rule:** User must be 21 or older on the day of purchase
```

## 6. Requirements Traceability

### 6.1 Traceability Matrix

Link requirements through the development lifecycle:

```markdown
| Requirement ID | User Story | Design Doc | Code Module | Test Case | Status |

```

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Requirements Writing Guidelines

1. **Use Active Voice**
   - ✅ "The system shall validate the user's credentials"
   - ❌ "User credentials shall be validated by the system"

2. **Be Specific and Measurable**
   - ✅ "Response time shall be less than 200ms for 95% of requests"
   - ❌ "The system shall be fast"

3. **Avoid Ambiguity**
   - ✅ "The system shall display an error message within 2 seconds"
   - ❌ "The system shall display an error message quickly"

4. **One Requirement Per Statement**
   - ✅ "The system shall encrypt passwords using bcrypt"
   - ✅ "The system shall enforce minimum password length of 8 characters"
   - ❌ "The system shall encrypt passwords and enforce complexity rules"

### 7.2 Requirements Review Checklist

Before finalizing requirements, verify:

- [ ] **Completeness**: All user needs addressed
- [ ] **Consistency**: No conflicting requirements
- [ ] **Feasibility**: Can be implemented with available resources
- [ ] **Testability**: Clear pass/fail criteria
- [ ] **Traceability**: Linked to business objectives
- [ ] **Clarity**: Understood by all stakeholders
- [ ] **Priority**: Importance clearly indicated
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Relationships identified

### 7.3 Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Solution Bias**
   - ❌ "Use PostgreSQL database for storage"
   - ✅ "Persist user data with ACID compliance"

2. **Negative Requirements**
   - ❌ "The system shall not crash"
   - ✅ "The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime"

3. **Compound Requirements**
   - ❌ "Users shall login and view their dashboard and update profile"
   - ✅ Separate into three distinct requirements

4. **Vague Quantities**
   - ❌ "Support many users"
   - ✅ "Support 10,000 concurrent users"
